            <b>In vitro studies</b>
            are research studies that are conducted in a laboratory dish or in a test tube, as opposed to in live animals (in vivo) or human subjects (clinical trials). These studies are used to investigate the effects of drugs, chemicals, or other interventions in a controlled environment, using isolated cells or tissues.

            In vitro studies are an important tool for understanding the basic mechanisms of disease and the effects of drugs on the activity of enzymes or proteins, or to test the toxicity of chemicals on cells, or the genetic or environmental factors on cells or tissues, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            In vitro studies are cost-effective, as they have a lower cost and less ethical considerations than in vivo studies. However, the results obtained from in vitro studies tend to be less reliable than findings from in vivo systems.
