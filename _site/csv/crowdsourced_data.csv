BDAI supports families affected by inherited bleeding disorders such as Hemophilia and von Willebrand disease by providing its members with the unbiased medical information and resources that allow them to live a healthy and active lifestyle.

These rare diseases, which affect about 1% of the general population, are often difficult to diagnose and are two of the most costly chronic disorders to treat. The ability to access reliable and unbiased information is especially important for families seeking answers and support soon after the initial diagnosis. BDAI serves as a non-profit connection between its members and the many medical providers, treatment centers, public and private insurance agencies and government programs that offer medical and financial assistance.

The organization also offers a welcoming community for families to meet, interact, and share information and advice. By providing popular social and education events for youth, families and parents throughout the year, BDAI helps foster a sense of connection between its members and provides continual opportunities to learn new ways to manage life with these disorders.

Through education and support, BDAI helps its members advocate on their own behalf with public and private insurance providers, medical providers, and government agencies while representing the bleeding community in the world at large.

Bleeding Disorders Alliance Illinois believes that, with the proper support and resources, its members have the potential to be defined not by their conditions, but by their contributions to the world.","Patient education (eg.

This will greatly accelerate the process of testing and ruling in, or out, potential CMT2A treatments.” AcuraStem’s success in using its precision medicine iNeuroRx™ platform to identify therapeutic targets and promising drugs for the treatment of neurological diseases, including ALS, suggests that a similar strategy potentially may be employed to identify therapeutics that could rapidly be developed or repositioned for individuals with CMT.

- Mitotane, a medication primarily used in patients with adrenal gland cancer, is also be used to lower cortisol levels. Like ketoconazole, mitotane blocks production of cortisol, but in higher doses it may also cause destruction of adrenal cells.
-Metyrapone is an agent that is available in the United States only on special request from the manufacturer. There are no good published studies on metyrapone’s effectiveness in CS.

Our Foundation is passionate in its support of programs and opportunities aimed at elevating the clinical paradigm for NMO patients and improving options for treatment, prevention, and an eventual cure for this disease.

We are committed to growing our on-line community for all NMO stakeholders, and to serving as a hub of leading-edge information resources as well as a gateway for all who seek to learn more. In our global outreach, we will continue to steward even more effective connections among academia, healthcare, industry and regulatory partnerships. By reducing barriers to cooperation, our mission is to bring breakthroughs from bench to bedside.

Fully aware that every moment makes a difference in the lives of those diagnosed with NMO, we are patient-centered and science-driven. With such innovations as our own bio-specimen collection network and repository, we dedicate ourselves to widening our outreach by continuing to grow the number of sites where patients can donate blood and clinical data vital for research. On a worldwide basis, we will continue to identify proof-of-concept clinical studies that lead to industry-sponsored clinical trials for promising NMO drugs. Our Foundation does not endorse, sponsor, or conduct these trials. Nor do we opt to participate in any monetary benefit from patents arising out of research we have funded; our grantees—individuals and institutions—retain full ownership of their intellectual property.

We recognize that our findings may serve as a model for helping address the global epidemic of autoimmune diseases and are resolute in developing improved communication tools that share our story of hope and urgency.

Halpin Foundation,http://www.halpinfoundation.org/,info@halpin.org,N/A,United States of America,"Understanding and Overcoming Genetic Medical Conditions

The Halpin Foundation seeks to aid the medical community in understanding and overcoming genetic conditions. To achieve the most impact with our funds, we prioritize our grants into two targeted goal areas: kidney disease research and autoimmune disease research. Today, autoimmune diseases are typically treated with immunosuppression -- medication that decreases the immune response and does not address the underlying genetic dispositions of the patient. We are encouraging researchers to identify the genetic basis for autoimmune diseases and kidney diseases such as Membranous Nephropathy (MN), which is often idiopathic.

Accomplishing Our Goals

To accomplish these goals, we use a variety of strategies. We support training, education, registries, research (including biomedical and genetic research), and projects that demonstrate the effective delivery of health care services. Rather than paying for individual care, we concentrate on health care systems and the conditions that promote better health now and for future generations. We believe that renal physiology, which is the study of kidney function, and nephrology, which is the specialty concerned with kidney diseases, both will make significant advances with the a greater understanding of the role of genetics and the application of personalized medications.

The Halpin Foundation supports a multi-disciplinary approach, which encourages translational research. As a result, grantees may be as varied as the challenges they tackle. They include: hospitals; independent physicians/researchers; medical, nursing, and public schools; professional associations; research organizations; government and community groups.

The Foundation is a non-profit medical research organization. No salaries, overhead or expenses are drawn and to that end one hundred percent of our funding goes toward the advancements we back.","Patient education (eg.

The New Hope Research Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to:

Helping find a genetic cure for GM2 gangliosidosis and other lysosomal storage
diseases that affect the central nervous system,

and

Providing hope to patients and their families currently facing the degenerative and
debilitating aspects of these diseases.  

To accomplish these goals, the New Hope Research Foundation has been established to
coordinate, conduct, and financially support:

Research on gene therapy and the means for infusing or delivering gene vectors to
correct lysosomal enzyme deficiencies of the central nervous system,

Clinical studies intended to show safety and efficacy of gene therapy for the central
nervous system aspects of lysosomal storage diseases,

Regulatory applications required to initiate investigations of clinical studies and the
regulatory submissions required to allow patient access to proven therapies, and

Education and communication for patients and families on the clinical manifestations
and molecular basis of gangliosidosis and related diseases, on the mechanism of gene
therapy, and on the status of related research and clinical studies.","Patient education (eg.

Clinical studies, funded by the New Hope Research Foundation, have shown that pyrimethamine serves as a pharmacological chaperone for the hexosaminidase enzyme and that pyrimethamine is thereby able to increase the level of the enzyme in Adult Tay-Sachs disease patients that express an unstable form of this enzyme. 
Mechanisms of enhancing expression of beta-hexosaminidase A Calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem or verapamil) have been shown to improve the expression of some lysosomal enzymes.  The goal of this project is to determine whether
calcium channel blockers might be synergistic with pharmacological chaperone therapy (e.g.,pyrimethamine) in the treatment of Adult Tay Sachs Diseases.  (Initial grant awarded - 2008)

Save Sight Now - Usher Syndrome Type 1B,https://www.savesightnow.org/our-mission,N/A,justin@savesightnow.org,United States of America,"https://www.savesightnow.org/our-mission
Usher syndrome type1 is a genetic disorder that robs children of their hearing and balance from birth and rapidly deteriorates their vision. Usher syndrome is the most common form of deaf blindness. Imagine navigating the world without sound, balance and vision. We’re focused on finding a treatment or cure for Retinitis Pigmentosa - the cause of blindness related to Usher syndrome.

Save Sight Now partnered with the world’s leading inherited retinal disease organization - Foundation Fighting Blindness - to identify and fund promising medical research that can save the vision of thousands of children and adults who are rapidly losing their sight.

Our goal is to ensure those living with Usher syndrome type 1B – an underserved community – do not lose another critical sense for experiencing and navigating the world around them. We know this is achievable because we’ve already seen successful treatments approved by the FDA for other forms of retinal diseases; and we’ve made it our goal to ensure researchers are prioritizing treatments for those that have already lost so much by funding their efforts.

While the majority of the research we fund has the potential to benefit all Ush types, our research targets are prioritizing treatments that will benefit individuals living with Usher syndrome type 1B.","Patient education (eg.

Although there is currently no curative therapy for individuals with Smith-Kingsmore syndrome, several individuals have been prescribed rapamycin / sirolimus. Early indicators show that some people with SKS have found benefits from taking rapamycin. Rapamycin is an mTOR inhibitor that binds to the protein and decreases activity in the mTOR pathway. It inhibits the hyperactivity of the mutant mTOR to maintain cellular homeostasis. As a result, it improves neurological and cognitive functions. Additionally, a large percentage of children diagnosed with SKS suffer from epilepsy. Some use rapamycin as a secondary medication for seizures and as a primary to optimize overall cognitive functions.

While FAVA did not manifest itself in my son's case until age seven, it is a condition that is present from birth.  Every FAVA patient has a unique journey of discovering, diagnosing, and living with FAVA.  Symptoms may present at any age, often spontaneously, and generally worsen over time.

When I was told there is no cure or slam dunk treatments for FAVA, I refused to accept our lack of options.  Further, I refused to accept that FAVA would be what stood between my son and his dream of becoming a professional soccer player.  When I asked our doctors what I could do as a parent and a layperson to move the needle towards better treatment options, I was told there are three primary areas of need – money for research, lobbying, and locating FAVA patients around the world.

​At Project FAVA, we have chosen to begin by conquering the latter.  Our primary goals are to:

Establish a central database of FAVA patients;

Establish a central location for disseminating information among our members; 

Let our members know of advancements in research and provide them an opportunity to play a role in that research if they so choose; and   

Develop and cultivate an active relationship between FAVA patients, the medical community, and researchers.
