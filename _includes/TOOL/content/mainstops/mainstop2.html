                    <p>
                        Drug identification is considered the first step in the process of drug repurposing. It involves identifying existing drugs that may have the potential to treat a particular rare disease. This can be done through various methods. We believe the most systematic ones can be separated into five categories:

                        <li>
                            Drug Screen approach

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pathogenesis targeting approach 

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Data from similar diseases approach

                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Data from similar diseases approach

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Computational approach

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Off-label use approach

                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        In our data, we have 94 (76 unique) drugs which are in process of being repurposed by 40 organizations. The most common drug identification method was preclinical/translational research (65 drugs). The other top choices were looking at drugs used in similar diseases (28), off-label use data analysis (24), high throughput drug screening (HTDS) (21) and literature review/meta-analysis (16). The least popular option was machine learning/artificial intelligence approaches (2), which may speak to the novelty of this approach and its slow integration into the existing research/repurposing processes or that it is mostly being utilized without the involvement of rare disease nonprofit organizations.

                    </h4>
<p>
    These methods of drug identification can be done simultaneously or in sequence, depending on the organization's resources and priorities. For example, an organization may choose to conduct a literature review to gather initial information on potential drug candidates, and then use computational methods to further narrow down the list of candidates. High-throughput screening can then be used as a final validation step to confirm the effectiveness of the identified drugs, or narrow the list done from several promising “hits”. Using multiple methods overall increases the chances of success in the drug repurposing process, as it could also save time and resources by avoiding testing drugs in later stages, which are not as likely to be effective.

</p>


<p>
    In our data, 57 drugs utilized more than one identification method. The most common combination of methods was HTDS and Preclinical/Translational research (11 cases) and looking at drugs used in similar diseases and Preclinical/Translational (9 cases). This speaks to the value of pursuing multiple avenues at once and triangulating the findings from one method with another. It is also interesting to point out that the 11 drugs were identified as promising in different ways for different rare diseases.
