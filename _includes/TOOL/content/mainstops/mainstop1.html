                   The ROADMAP tool is an interactive tool that maps out the paths and steps that can be taken to repurpose drugs as well as the roadblocks, resources, and stakeholders involved in rare disease drug repurposing. While we primarily focus on repurposing FDA-approved drugs for new diseases, we provide some information about repurposing not-yet-approved drugs for new diseases. Created by the CDCN in partnership with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Every Cure, the goal of this tool is to porovide rare disease researchers and organizations the knowledge and resources they need to unlock existing medicines that can save lives.

            Based on our experiences with drug repurposing, 605 survey responses which made inclusion criteria from rare disease stakeholders, and 25 in-depth interviews, we have organized the drug repurposing process into 5 steps:

            <li>Supporting repurposing</li>
            <li>Identifying the drug</li>
            <li>Validating the drug</li>
            <li>Utilizing the drug clinically</li>
            <li>Reaching an endpoint</li>
        </ol>

            Throughout all of these steps, there are many ways that rare disease non profit organizations can play a supportive role or some aspects of the drug repurposing process, which we detail throughout the tool.
