    Among the stakeholders involved in the drug repurposing process, a rare disease nonprofit organization is a very powerful intermediary between the patients, researchers, physicians, regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other actors. Their power lies in leveraging their personal passion and perseverance against all odds to help the patients and their ability to create and foster the right ecosystem in which opportunities to drive forward drug repurposing efforts for their rare disease(s) can flourish. 
</p>

<p>
    The main support options in which a rare disease organization can support a drug repurposing projects fall into four somewhat overlapping categories:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Funding Support
    </li>
    <li>
        Research Support
    </li>
    <li>
        Partnering & Collaboration Support
    </li>
    <li class = "mb-5">
        Patient Support
    </li>

</ol>

    Funding support
</h2>

<p>
    Drug repurposing projects cannot get started without sufficient financial resources in place. At any stage in the process, a rare disease nonprofit can play two roles: as a fundraising entity and as a grant-giving entity.  

</p>

<p>
    There are many ways an organization can raise money. One way to think about this is to focus on different entities that can contribute funds:

</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Patients & their families
    </li>
    <li>
        Individual large donors
    </li>
    <li>
        Government organizations
    </li>
    <li>
        Other nonprofit organizations
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The traditional approach to a rare disease non profit organization supporting research involves organizations raising funds, announcing a request for proposals (RFP) that invites researchers to submit a research proposal (a research question, approach to answering the question, and budget) that addresses the question or area of research described in the RFP, and then awarding funds to the best proposal, selected by a panel of experts (Figure 1).

    <figcaption>The traditional model of an organization supporting research</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>
    This traditional, researcher-centric model works well when there are a large number of applicants and barriers to accessing key research material are low.  When the number of interested and qualified researchers in an area is limited, as in the rare disease space, it is less probable that a single proposal will both address a high-impact question and be submitted by the most qualified researcher. The RFP process also may lead to competition between researchers and limit collaboration, where samples and research ideas become assets for grant applications. This is particularly problematic for rare disease research as patient samples are inherently scarce. Without a sufficient number of samples, meaningful insights cannot be made. Another critical problem with the traditional model is that patients – the very people who share the lived experience and are in need of treatments and solutions – are often not involved in crafting or molding research priorities (Korsunska, 2021). 

</p>

<p>
    An alternative to the researcher-centric model is the “Collaborative Network Approach” (Zuccato et al., 2019). It consists of eight steps and leverages and integrates the entire community of stakeholders — patients, loved ones, physicians and researchers — to identify and prioritize high-impact research questions. One of the most important steps of this approach is a crowdsourcing process, which “allows the entire community to identify the most clinically relevant and pressing questions; any idea can be translated into a study rather than limiting research to the ideas proposed by researchers in grant applications” (Zuccato et al., 2019, p. 1).

    </div>

    <p>
        Once the research priorities are determined and key studies are defined, the organization then recruits the most qualified researchers to conduct these studies. At the same time, patients are empowered to support research through fundraising and providing their biospecimens and clinical data.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Regardless of the fundraising or grant-giving model, there are very many things a rare disease nonprofit can contribute funding to, such as:
    </p>


<p>*The details will be explored in more detail in the <b>“Research support”</b> section.</p>

<p>
    Thinking specifically about drug repurposing, regardless of organization age or size, through leveraging an active community of patients, loved ones, as well as larger donors and philanthropists, a rare disease organization can start to create a “seed” funding budget for research projects which either directly or indirectly relate to drug repurposing. Even if these might be small grants not enough to complete large-scale projects, if the organization partners with the right researchers and they pursue the right research questions, these small grants can enable the first proof-of-concept studies to take place, enabling the researchers to then apply for larger grants from places like the FDA, NIH, etc.

    Research support
</h2>

<p>
    Though many rare disease nonprofit organizations chose to focus only on patient support (providing a space for patients to connect, access physician lists, discuss treatment outcomes, etc.), a large portion (in our survey data, 127 out of 147 organizations were supporting research, and another 18 plan to do so in the future) also support research in their rare disease in one way or another. 

</p>

<p>
    Many organizations also don’t “put all their eggs in one basket”, and are able to simultaneously pursue novel drug development, gene therapy and drug repurposing. Drug repurposing for some rare diseases can provide a drug that provides full remission for at least some portion of patients, while for others it can simply be a good option to reduce symptoms, slow disease progression or improve quality of life in other ways until a more targeted drug can be developed. Drug repurposing, whether it is successful or not, also helps improve understanding of rare diseases and treatment reactions, which can help support better and potentially faster novel drug development.

</p>

<p>
    Regardless of the type of research, a rare disease nonprofit organization can play several important support roles:

</p>

<ol>
    <li>
            Leading the creation of patient-centered research agenda

    </li>
    <li>
            Creating research infrastructure & gathering data/samples for future research

    </li>
    <li>
            Providing data/samples to researchers & supporting clinical trials

    </li>

</ol>

<h3>Leading the creation of patient-centered research agenda</h3>

<p>

    Though researchers may be experts in their field, a rare disease nonprofit organization can provide crucial insight which cannot be found in peer-review publications which is based on the real-world patient experience of having a rare disease. Traditional approaches to research-prioritization tend to be researcher-centric, leaving out the very people who share the lived experience and are in need of treatments and solutions. There are things that are important to patients, which may not be prioritized from a research perspective. For example, though extension of survival is definitely important for both researchers and patients, a researcher may be surprised to learn that quality of life is more important for some populations than a marginal increase in overall survival rates. Patients with chronic rare diseases care about the effects of the rare disease or the treatments on more “everyday” things like fertility, cognitive development, as well as a decrease in overall pain or inconvenient drug delivery methods (needing to drive to a hospital to get regular treatments). This is why it is crucial that rare disease research is focused not only on filling the gaps in the literature, but also on the needs of the patient population. For example, the CDCN developed a novel approach to advancing biomedical research, called the “Collaborative Network Approach” (Zuccato et al., 2019). To overcome the limitations of the traditional research model, the CDCN’s “Collaborative Network Approach” leverages and integrates the entire community of stakeholders — patients, loved ones, physicians and researchers — to identify and prioritize high-impact research questions through a process called the <a href = "https://cdcn.org/aim2021/" target = "_blank"> In Movement</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to keeping the pulse of what is most important to the patient and loved one community, a rare disease nonprofit can also do extensive literature review to keep itself up to date on the latest research on its rare disease in question. This has a lot of potential benefits as it may:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Create an additional value-add on the nonprofit as a potential collaborator with both academics or pharmaceutical companies

        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Create opportunities to form cross-disease collaborations

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Identify new potential drugs to repurpose

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Enable the organization to learn from other nonprofits (what's already been done, what's in progress, what's planned elsewhere. You don't want to reinvent the wheel, repeat studies that have already been executed or are underway or are being planned, etc.)

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Identify researchers to collaborate with, invite to events, or to be a part of your SAB/MAB

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Learn how to model research approaches, including designs of clinical trials

        </p>
    </li>

</ul>


<h3>Creating research infrastructure & gathering data/samples for future research</h3>

<p>
    A rare disease nonprofit organization can help fund the development of research resources (cell lines, mouse models, etc.), and genetic testing/screening, which may provide valuable insight into the disease ____________, as well as potentially vital research databases, such as a biobank or natural history study/registry. This data and research samples can then be made available to researchers to pursue various studies, including ones that can lead to a drug being identified for repurposing. The following are examples of some of the types of infrastructure an organization can set up and maintainL
