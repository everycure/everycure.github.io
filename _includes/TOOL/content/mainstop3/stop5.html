    <b>Off-label drug use</b> refers to the use of a drug for a disease that has not been specifically approved by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA in the US. It is quite common and is used in cases where a drug has been found to be potentially safe and effective for a new disease through research, or a physician has reason to believe it may help a patient from their own medical knowledge or anecdotal reports from other doctors. Additionally, doctors may prescribe drugs off-label for the disease which the drug is approved for, but for a different population, such as children, pregnant women, or other populations, which were not included in the original clinical trials. This can be incredibly helpful for patients that are not responding to the standard of care or have no standard of care for their disease. However, off-label use of drugs can also have risks. Since the safety and effectiveness of a drug for off-label use have often not been established, there is a potential for adverse events or lack of efficacy.

    <b>Evaluating off-label use</b> of drugs in a rare disease of interest can help to identify drugs that should be studied further for that rare disease. 
  </p>

  <p>
    To be able to utilize off-label drug use as an avenue for drug identification, rare disease nonprofits and researchers can implement one of the following few strategies:

      <p><b>Surveys and questionnaires</b></p>
      <p>
        Surveys and questionnaires can be used to gather information from patients and caregivers about their experiences with off-label drug use. These surveys can be distributed through the nonprofit's website, social media, or mailing list, and can include questions about the types of drugs being used, the reasons for off-label use, and the outcomes of treatment.

      <p><b>Literature review</b></p>
      <p> 
        Nonprofits can help conduct literature reviews of existing studies and publications to identify information about off-label drug use in their patient populations. This can include searching for articles and studies that have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and reviewing data from clinical trials and observational studies. This information can then be provided to the researcher’s in the nonprofits’ network to evaluate whether any of the drugs are promising enough to pursue.

    Among the <b>147</b> organizations surveyed, only <b>17</b> (<b>12%</b>) track off-label drug use within their patient populations. This includes <b>16/111</b> (<b>14.41%</b>) of the organizations that support research and <b>12/58</b> (<b>20.69%</b>) of those that are pursuing drug repurposing. Looking at the <b>5</b> organizations that have successfully received FDA approval, only <b>1</b> organization (<b>20%</b>) tracks off-label drug use. Of the <b>12</b> organizations that use a drug off-label with some measures of success, <b>5</b> (<b>41.7%</b>) track off-label drug use. <b>25/94</b> (<b>27%</b>) of the drug repurposing projects in the ROADMAP were first identified from off-label drug use data. Among the <b>17</b> organizations that track off-label drugs, <b>5</b> (<b>29%</b>) of them utilized this data in an ongoing drug repurposing project as a drug identification method.

    Though these are all correlational relationships, it does suggest that tracking off-label drug use in your patient population, either informally through simple patient surveys or systematically through a natural history study, can be helpful in identifying potentially helpful drugs for a rare disease.
