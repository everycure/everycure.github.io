  <h1 class="mb-5">Evaluation of RWE</h1>

  <p><b>Real World Evidence (RWE)</b> refers to data collected in routine clinical practice, outside of the controlled
    environment of a clinical trial. This type of evidence can provide valuable information on the safety and
    effectiveness of a drug in a real-world setting, in a broader patient population and with longer follow-up.

        RWE can come from various sources, such as electronic health records (EHRs), claims data, and patient-reported
        outcomes (PROs). EHRs contain detailed information on patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes,
        and can provide a wealth of information on a drug's safety and effectiveness in real-world settings. Claims
        data, which is collected by insurance providers, can also provide valuable information on a drug's utilization
        and effectiveness. PROs can provide insights into patients' experiences and outcomes and can be used to gather
        information on a drug's impact on quality of life.

      However, in the case of repurposed drugs, there may be limited RWE available, which can make it difficult to
      determine its effectiveness in the patient population of interest. This can be particularly challenging for rare
      diseases, as the patient population is small and the disease may have a different manifestation in different
      patients.
