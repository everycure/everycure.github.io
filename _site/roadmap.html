            There are ∼7000 rare diseases affecting approximately 30,000,000 individuals in the U.S.A. and 95% of these rare diseases do not have a single Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy. Since the incentives for new drug development for rare diseases are limited, drug repurposing provides a promising way to identify effective treatments for rare diseases faster and cheaper than developing new drugs. Still, many challenges exist in the drug repurposing space.

            <p>
              The ROADMAP tool is the culmination of the Repurposing Of All Drugs, Mapping All Paths (ROADMAP) project, pursued by the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN). The CDCN identified as many rare disease nonprofit organizations and potential stakeholders as possible, distributed a survey to these stakeholders, and performed in-depth interviews with a subgroup of representative stakeholders. Then, we utilized this information along with our experiences from rare disease drug repurposing to build out the ROADMAP tool.

            <a type="button" class="about-button my-5" href = "/about.html">Learn more about the ROADMAP project, its data sources and tool development</a>

            <p class = "mt-2">Based on our experiences with drug repurposing, 605 survey responses which made inclusion criteria from rare disease stakeholders, and 25 in-depth interviews, we have organized the drug repurposing process into 5 steps:</p>

            <ol class="my-4">
              <li>Supporting repurposing</li>
              <li>Identifying the drug</li>
              <li>Validating the drug</li>
              <li>Utilizing the drug clinically</li>
              <li>Reaching an endpoint</li>

            </ol>


            <p><b>Supporting repurposing</b> involves laying the groundwork to be able to successfully repurpose a treatment for your rare disease. This may involve setting up a rare disease non profit, creating the vital research infrastructure, fundraising or applying for grants that you can then provide to researchers, creating a contact registry of all your patients, creating a network of researchers and physicians who are already or potentially could be doing work related to your rare disease, and/or developing certain resources, such as a biobank or a natural history study/registry.
            </p>

            <p><b>Identifying the drug</b> describes the next step in the repurposing process. It entails identifying  existing drug(s) that may be potentially beneficial for your patient population of interest. There are many ways this can be done (high throughput drug screens, machine learning data mining, analysis of real world off-label drug use, etc.), which we explore in detail in the ROADMAP.
            </p>

            <p><b>Validating the drug</b> explains the  important step in which the initial hypothesis about the potential of the identified drug(s) is tested in the laboratory or through other research approaches. This step is sometimes skipped.

            </p>
            <p><b>Utilizing the drug clinically</b> - if the drug seems promising enough for the anticipated benefits to outweigh the anticipated risks, it can move on to being used in patients, either in an official clinical trial or through an “off-label” prescription by a physician.
            </p>

            <p><b>Reaching an endpoint</b> refers to  the final step in the drug repurposing process. Once the drug has been given to patients, it should be evaluated to determine if it is effective and which patients should receive it.  Though FDA-approval for the new disease is often thought of as success, many drugs are never reviewed by the FDA and there are several potential positive outcomes of drug repurposing, such as inclusion of the drug in treatment guidelines and off-label use of the drug in patients that improves quality of life. Failure is defined as the drug being abandoned due to issues with safety or efficacy, whether or not it is approved by the FDA for this new use.
            </p>

            <p class = "mb-5">
              Throughout all of these steps, there are many ways that rare disease non profit organizations can play a supportive role or some aspects of the drug repurposing process, which we detail throughout the tool.

                    <p>
                        Among the stakeholders involved in the drug repurposing process, rare disease nonprofit organizations are a powerful intermediary between the patients, researchers, physicians, regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other actors. Their power lies in leveraging their personal passion and perseverance against all odds to help patients and create and foster the right ecosystem to drive forward drug repurposing efforts for their rare disease(s). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ways that a rare disease organization can support drug repurposing projects fall into four somewhat overlapping categories:

                                Drug identification is considered the first step in the process of drug repurposing. It involves identifying existing drugs that may have the potential to treat a particular rare disease. This can be done through various methods. We believe the most systematic ones can be separated into five categories:

                        In our data, we have 94 (76 unique) drugs which are in process of being repurposed by 40 organizations. The most common drug identification method was preclinical/translational research (65 drugs). The other top choices were looking at drugs used in similar diseases (28), off-label use data analysis (24), high throughput drug screening (HTDS) (21) and literature review/meta-analysis (16). The least popular option was machine learning/artificial intelligence approaches (2), which may speak to the novelty of this approach and its slow integration into the existing research/repurposing processes or that it is mostly being utilized without the involvement of rare disease nonprofit organizations.

                    <h4>
                        Benefits of multiple methods


                    </h4>
<p>
    These methods of drug identification can be done simultaneously or in sequence, depending on the organization's resources and priorities. For example, an organization may choose to conduct a literature review to gather initial information on potential drug candidates, and then use computational methods to further narrow down the list of candidates. High-throughput screening can then be used as a final validation step to confirm the effectiveness of the identified drugs, or narrow the list done from several promising “hits”. Using multiple methods overall increases the chances of success in the drug repurposing process, as it could also save time and resources by avoiding testing drugs in later stages, which are not as likely to be effective.

</p>


<p>
    In our data, 57 drugs utilized more than one identification method. The most common combination of methods was HTDS and Preclinical/Translational research (11 cases) and looking at drugs used in similar diseases and Preclinical/Translational (9 cases). This speaks to the value of pursuing multiple avenues at once and triangulating the findings from one method with another. It is also interesting to point out that the 11 drugs were identified as promising in different ways for different rare diseases.

                        The validation stage of drug repurposing is a crucial step in determining whether a drug candidate is safe and effective in treating a specific rare disease. This stage typically involves conducting additional studies, prior to moving forward with clinical trials. This stage can be separated into in vivo and in vitro studies, as well as preliminary validation through real-world evidence. Once the validation stage is completed, the organization can move forward with clinical trials to gather more robust data on the drug's safety and efficacy in human subjects with the rare disease.

                        Once the drug is shown to be promising and preliminarily safe and effective, it must be tested in humans before being submitted to FDA for approval or integrated into treatment guidelines. This is traditionally done either through clinical trial testing and/or real world off-label use tracking. Clinical trials provide robust data on the drug's safety and efficacy in human subjects with the disease, and are necessary for obtaining FDA approval and making the drug available to patients, while off-label use tracking can provide additional data on the safety and efficacy of the drug in real-world settings.

                    <p>
                        There are many ways we can conceptualize “success” in a drug repurposing project. One obvious and traditional marker is receiving FDA approval, but it is important to note that there are very many factors that affect whether a drug can ever get FDA approval that do not depend on its safety, efficacy and are beyond the control of a researcher or a rare disease nonprofit organization supporting a drug repurposing project. Notably the most important of these is the drug’s patent status, which affects the level of interest by a pharmaceutical company to invest time and money into supporting the FDA approval application. Thus, we consider FDA approval as not the best success metric if we consider that the most important outcome is getting treatments to rare disease patients with enough efficacy and safety data, thus we can consider what alternative definitions of success can be used to evaluate the outcome of a drug repurposing project, as well as when it should be considered as abandoned.

    <p>
        Drug repurposing projects require financial resources. In order to support these projects, a rare disease nonprofit serves two intertwined functions, as a fundraising entity and as a fund-allocating entity.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "sectionheading">Fundraising</h2>

    <p>
        There are many ways an organization can raise money. One way to think about this is to focus on different entities that can contribute funds:

        <li>
            Patients & their families

    <p>*The details will be explored in more detail in the <b>“Research support”</b> section. </p>
      
    <p>
        It is also important to note that there are different approaches to how a nonprofit organization can select which research and researchers to fund.  
    </p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The traditional approach involves an organization announcing a request for proposals (RFP) that invites researchers to submit a research proposal (a research question, approach to answering the question, and budget) that addresses the question or area of research described in the RFP. The organization then reviews and awards funds to the best proposal(s).
    </li>
    <li>
        An alternative to the researcher-centric model is the “Collaborative Network Approach” (16). It consists of eight steps and leverages and integrates the entire community of stakeholders — patients, loved ones, physicians and researchers — to identify and prioritize high-impact research questions. One of the most important steps of this approach is a crowdsourcing process, which “allows the entire community to identify the most clinically relevant and pressing questions; any idea can be translated into a study rather than limiting research to the ideas proposed by researchers in grant applications”. Read more about the Collaborative Network Approach at <a href = "https://cdcn.org/about-us/our-approach" target = "_blank">https://cdcn.org/about-us/our-approach</a>. 
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Regardless of the amount raised or grant allocation approach, rare disease organizations can start to create a “seed” funding budget for research projects which either directly or indirectly relate to drug repurposing. Even if these are small grants that may not be enough to complete large-scale projects, these small grants can enable the first proof-of-concept studies to take place, enabling the researchers to then apply for larger grants from entities  like the FDA, NIH, etc.

    <h1 class="mb-5">Research support</h1>

    <p>
        Drug repurposing is primarily a research process in order to identify and validate treatments for diseases,
        which have not been tried before. Nearly all (86%) of the rare disease nonprofit organizations that completed
        the ROADMAP survey support research in their rare disease in one way or another, while 58 (40%) are supporting a
        drug repurposing project now, or have in the past. Many organizations split up their research funding between
        novel drug development, gene therapy and drug repurposing. Drug repurposing for some rare diseases can provide a
        drug that provides full remission for at least some portion of patients, while for others it can simply be a
        good option to reduce symptoms, slow disease progression or improve quality of life in other ways until a more
        targeted drug can be developed. Drug repurposing, whether it is successful or not, also helps improve
        understanding of rare diseases and treatments, which can help support better and potentially faster novel drug
        development.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rare disease nonprofit organizations can play several important roles in supporting various types of research
        related to drug repurposing by:

                Though researchers may be experts in their field, a rare disease nonprofit organization can provide
                crucial insight based on the patient experience of having a rare disease. There are things that are
                important to patients, which may not be prioritized from a research perspective. For example, quality of
                life is more important for some populations than a marginal increase in overall survival rates; patients
                with chronic rare diseases may care about the effects of the rare disease or the treatments on more
                “everyday” things like fertility, cognitive development, as well as a decrease in overall pain or
                inconvenient drug delivery methods (needing to drive to a hospital to get regular treatments). This is
                why it is crucial that rare disease research is focused not only on filling the gaps in the literature,
                but also on the needs of the patient population. One example of this approach is CDCN’s <a
                    href="https://cdcn.org/aim2021/" target="_blank">All In Movement</a>, which leverages and integrates
                the entire community of stakeholders — patients, loved ones, physicians and researchers — to identify
                and prioritize high-impact research questions.

    </div>
    <p>
        In addition to keeping the pulse of what is most important to the patient and loved one community, a rare
        disease nonprofit can also do extensive literature review to keep itself up to date on the latest research on
        its rare disease. This has a lot of potential benefits as it may:

    <p>
        Rare disease nonprofit organizations can help fund the development of research resources, such as cell lines,
        mouse models, biobanks, natural history studies and patient registries. These data and research samples can then
        be made available to researchers to pursue various studies, including ones that can lead to a drug being
        identified for repurposing. The following are examples of some of the types of infrastructure an organization

                One of the most foundational ways a rare disease nonprofit organization can support research is for it
                to act as an intermediary between the patients and the researchers/physicians. In this way, its contact
                registry (a database of contact information for all your rare disease patients) becomes an incredibly
                valuable resource. It can be used to gather data, spread the news about opportunities to participate in
                clinical trials, and share research findings (including new treatment options as a result of
                repurposing).

            <p>
                A biobank is a storage facility for biological samples for use in research. These samples may include human tissues of any type (blood, lymph node, etc.) These samples can be included in basic research around disease mechanisms through translational research leading to treatments. Biobanks have the potential to accelerate rare disease research by providing access for researchers to high quality biological samples for their research. The operating costs of biobanks vary widely based on the scale of the operation. Though the costs can be beyond the scope of smaller organizations, there are commercially operated biobanks which can be hired to outsource the biobanking of rare disease tissue specimens. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the 147 organizations surveyed in this project, 45 (31%) utilize a biobank. This includes 24 (41.38%) of the 58 organizations that are pursuing drug repurposing. Looking at organizations that have successfully repurposed drugs, 1/6 (16.67%) of the organizations thatwho have had a drug FDA approved through a drug repurposing project have a biobank and 5/13 (38.46%) organizations which have reached a “subjective” success endpoint utilize a biobank. Among the 5 organizations who had a drug FDA-approved through a drug repurposing project, one (16.67%) has a biobank. Having a biobank of samples can be helpful in supporting several types of research projects which may lead to identifying potentially helpful drugs for a rare disease.

            </p>
            <p>
                Among the 147 organizations surveyed, 59/147 (40%) utilize a natural history study or patient registry. This includes 52/111 (47%) of the organizations that support research and 30/58 (78%) of those that are pursuing drug repurposing. Looking at organizations thatour successfully repurposed drugs organizations, 4/6 (66.67%)  of the organizations who have had a drug FDA approved and 8/13 (61.54%) of organizations which have reached a “subjective” success endpoint utilize a natural history study or registry and 4/6 (67%) of the organizations who have had a drug FDA approved utilize an NHR or NHS. These findings ough these are all correlational relationships, it does suggest that having a natural history study or registry can be helpful in supporting several types of research projects which may lead to identifying potentially helpful drugs for a rare disease.

                <b>Tracking off-label drug use</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Off-label drug use</b> refers to the use of a drug for a disease that has not been specifically approved by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA in the US. It is quite common and is used in cases where a drug has been found to be potentially safe and effective for a new disease through research, or a physician has reason to believe it may help a patient from their own medical knowledge or anecdotal reports from other doctors. This can be incredibly helpful for patients that are not responding to the standard of care or have no standard of care for their disease. However, off-label use of drugs can also have risks. Since the safety and effectiveness of a drug for an off-label use have not been established, there is a potential for adverse events or lack of efficacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Tracking off-label drug use</b> can provide information on how well the drug works in different populations or for different conditions, as preliminary data to more formal research, or in lieu of formal research. This can serve as justification to support the official integration of this treatment into treatment guidelines or help a patient gain access to a drug via letter to an insurance company, if the request for coverage was denied. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To be able to utilize off-label drug use as an avenue for drug identification, rare disease nonprofits can systematically track off-label drug use in their patient populations by implementing a few different strategies:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Surveys and questionnaires</b>: Surveys and questionnaires can be used to gather information from patients and caregivers about their experiences with off-label drug use. These surveys can be distributed through the nonprofit's website, social media, or mailing list, and can include questions about the types of drugs being used, the reasons for off-label use, and the outcomes of treatment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Patient registries</b>: Registries can be used to collect and track information about patients with a specific rare disease, including information about the treatments that patients are receiving and its effects (and side effects) over time. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Collaboration with healthcare providers</b>: Nonprofits can collaborate with healthcare providers to gather information about off-label drug use in their patient populations in order to identify trends and patterns in off-label drug use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Literature review</b>: Nonprofits can help identify information about off-label drug use in their patient populations by searching for articles and studies that have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and reviewing data from clinical trials and observational studies. 
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Among the 147 organizations surveyed, only 17/147 (12%) track off-label drug use within their patient populations. This includes 16/111 (14.41%) of the organizations that support research and 12/58 (20.69%) of those that are pursuing drug repurposing. Looking at organizations that have successfully repurposed drugsour successful organizations, 2/6 (33.33%) of the organizations who have had a drug FDA approved and  5/13 (38.46%) of organizations  which have reached a “subjective” success endpoint track off-label drug use and 2/6 (33%) of the organizations who have had a drug FDA approved do this. By searching for examples of when a drug is used off-label and has an effect can help to identify that drug as a potential promising approach for further steps in drug repurposing. 25 (27%) of the drug repurposing projects in the ROADMAP were first identified from off-label drug use data. Among the 17 organizations that track off-label drugs, 5 (29%) of them utilized this data in an ongoing drug repurposing project as a drug identification method. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Though these are all correlational relationships, it does suggest that tracking off-label drug use in your patient population, either informally through simple patient surveys or systematically through a natural history study, can be helpful in identifying potentially helpful drugs for a rare disease.

        3. Providing data/samples to researchers & supporting clinical trials
    </h2>

    <img src="/assets/svg/icons8/marginalia-696.png" class="img-fluid" />

    <p>
        Rare disease nonprofits have a crucial role to play in the support of research in early stages by facilitating researcher access to existing resources, such as patient registry data, biobank samples, contact registry information, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In later stages, rare disease nonprofits can support clinical trials in various ways:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Clinical trial recruitment</b>: serving as a resource for researchers and clinical trial PIs to recruit participants while simultaneously actively seeking out and sharing information about clinical trials for their patient population.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Patient education</b>: informing patients of eligible trials and discussing the pros and cons of participation, including potential consequences such as ending up on a placebo, associated costs, or having to stop taking a drug after clinical trial completion.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Leading or assisting in clinical trial protocol design</b>: assisting in the design of clinical trial protocols, depending on their collaboration and expertise. They can act as the administrative PI (writing the protocol, the MOU, and the application to the FDA, even if they do not have scientific or medical expertise) and provide input on protocol design to better represent patient needs and facilitate recruitment. They can also provide expertise on important clinical measures and endpoints. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Advocate for certain subpopulations</b>: adding or coordinating clinical trial sites, facilitating conversations with pharma companies to expand their ongoing clinical trials to include a specific subtype of rare disease patients to a clinical trial, or to add expansion cohorts to ongoing trials. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Collaborating with other rare disease nonprofits</b>: creating opportunities for collaboration such as joint-funding, increasing size of clinical trials, sharing data and samples, etc. For example, basket trials can help defray costs, coordinate efforts, lean on a shared infrastructure and PIs, benefiting multiple rare disease patient populations simultaneously. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Funding</b>: providing either seed funding, which can enable researchers to do preliminary work to then qualify for larger grants for clinical trials, or provide extra funding if external funding is insufficient to support a clinical trial. With enough funding, a rare disease nonprofit can potentially support multiple ongoing clinical trials, i.e. have eggs in multiple baskets to raise the chances of having a successful outcome. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There are many potential benefits to patients if a clinical trial is successful, such as more data on the safety and efficacy of existing treatments for various different patient populations, or new treatment options becoming available for them. There are also other benefits for the nonprofit itself in supporting clinical trials, such as - expanding their patient network, especially internationally. It also provides a great milestone in its mission to support research, which can serve as both internal motivation and help cement the idea that a rare disease nonprofit is able to be a partner in further rare disease research with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions.

    <img src="/assets/svg/icons8/marginalia-1248.png" class="img-fluid" />

    <p>
        One of the greatest assets of a rare disease nonprofit organization is its ability to weave networks. A network of patients and loved ones becomes a community, where information sharing, support and advice can make a huge difference and combat the fear and anxiety of a rare disease diagnosis. A researcher network can bring together everyone who already is or is interested in doing research related to the rare disease of interest so they can share insights, data, samples and work together to apply for grants and complete work that can save lives. Outside of those two main networks, there are also other opportunities for collaboration that can bring great value to a rare disease community, but may be less known:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Collaboration with academics</b>: making sure the research questions are patient-need-centered, providing funding, access to patient data and samples, helping with clinical trial design, recruitment, education, and forming a Scientific or Medical Advisory board (SAB/MAB). As with any partnership, it’s important to initiate a formal contract or clear rules of conduct, in which the nonprofit retains ownership of any data it provides or facilitates the use of, and has access to any research findings that result as a part of the research project it is supporting. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Collaboration with pharmaceutical companies and biotech companies</b>: collaboration with pharma is a roadblock for organizations pursuing  drug repurposing 17/58 (29.31%) and one of the main reasons for non-pursuers 31/77 (40.26%). Still, collaborations are possible by aligning interests and incentives. Rare disease nonprofits can initiate these collaborations by inviting pharma representatives to patient and research conferences, and showing them the impact they can have on the patient population; they then can become "internal champions", who can advocate for the interests of the nonprofit internally within the pharma company. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Collaboration with other rare disease nonprofits</b>: connecting with other rare disease nonprofits, whether it is ones that are focusing on the same rare disease, a similar rare disease, or one that doesn’t seem to be related at all, can lead to benefits such as combining patient populations, funding, and resources, creating a bigger impact and advancing research for both rare diseases. Overlap such as common drugs, side effects, and comorbidities can lead to new connections between research spaces, potentially resulting in impactful scientific breakthroughs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Collaboration with government organizations</b>: nonprofits can influence the FDA's policies and guidelines for rare diseases and help to create a more favorable environment for rare disease research. By working with other rare disease nonprofits, they can raise awareness of the unique challenges faced by rare disease patients, such as the lack of treatments and limited access to clinical trials; they can provide feedback on draft guidance documents, participate in public meetings and workshops, and by provide expertise on specific rare diseases.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Provide treatment-related assistance</b> to patients by working with insurance companies to ensure coverage and promote patient access to new drugs that have been approved by the FDA, or off-label drugs which have been newly identified or being tested in the drug repurposing process.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Facilitate compassionate use access</b>, which allows patients with a serious or life-threatening disease to access investigational drugs outside of clinical trials, if the patients are not eligible or if the clinical trial does not happen for various reasons.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Provide access to a network of physicians</b> who are the most knowledgeable about the disease and the treatments available, including ones that are involved in drug repurposing projects. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Provide access to genetic testing</b> for patients to determine if they have a specific rare disease and help identify appropriate treatment options, which may lead to the identification of new drug repurposing opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Disseminate rare disease-specific educational information</b> to patients, families, and healthcare providers through various channels such as their website, social media, newsletters and patient conferences. This may include research results, updated treatment guidelines, lists of ongoing clinical trials, etc.

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Drug screen approach</h1>

    <p>
      High-throughput drug  screening (HTDS) is a method of rapidly screening anywhere from 100,000 to 1,000,0000 of compounds from existing libraries to identify those that have a specific biological activity at the model organism, cellular, pathway, or molecular level. This process is used in early stages of drug discovery to identify potential drug candidates and in drug repurposing to identify new potential uses for existing drugs. The goal of HTDS is to identify active compounds from a library of potential candidates as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Compounds that affect the target in an anticipated way are called hits, and the screens may be restricted to compounds that have already been tested in humans, thereby reducing the need for extensive preclinical tests. These hit compounds become candidates for the starting point for the development of drugs. A HTDS can produce a huge number of hits which are then further optimized and validated to remove any artifacts or ‘noise’ from the screen through further validation testing. The validated hits are studied reducing the number of compounds which then are entered into a lead optimization step to yield a drug candidate to study in clinical trials.

    </p>

    <p>One important aspect of HTDS that is important to consider is that it can be quite expensive, as it requires access to a highly specialized screening facility and compound libraries which many labs may not be able to afford, though there are third-party providers like Contract Research Organizations (CRO) or core facilities which may reduces costs for nonprofits. 
    </p>

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Pathogenesis targeting approach</h1>

  <p>
    <b>Pathogenesis targeting</b> refers to the process of identifying and targeting the underlying biological mechanisms or
    "pathways" that cause a disease. By understanding the pathogenesis of a disease, researchers can identify key
    molecules or processes that are involved in the disease process, and develop therapies that target these specific
    pathways. This could involve identifying the specific genetic mutations, immune cells, pathways or other changes
    that lead to the development and progression of a disease, and identifying existing therapies that target these
    changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the context of drug repurposing, the pathogenesis-targeting approach is a strategy that focuses on identifying
    drugs that target the underlying biological mechanisms of a disease, rather than focusing on the symptoms. This
    approach can be used to repurpose drugs that have already been approved for other indications, by identifying drugs
    that target the underlying mechanisms of a rare disease.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, the CDCN uncovered that over activation of mTOR was important to the pathogenesis of Castleman disease
    and then found an approved mTOR inhibitor that it began testing on patients. More about this story <a href="https://cdcn.org/repurposecd/" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <h1 class="mb-5">Data from similar diseases approach</h1>

      <p>
            Rare disease nonprofit organizations can identify promising drugs for repurposing by researching drugs that
            have been developed for similar diseases. They also collaborate with other organizations and researchers in
            order to share information and pool resources for drug development. Even though rare diseases can be complex
            and vary greatly even between patients and subtypes of the same rare disease, there are various ways to find
            opportunities for collaboration and similarities which may be helpful in identifying promising treatments.
            If the similarities between the different rare diseases are not yet known, they can be identified through
            genomic analysis (studying the genetic makeup of patients with different rare diseases to identify common
            genetic mutations or variations that may indicate an overlap), phenotypic analysis (studying the observable
            characteristics or symptoms of patients with different rare diseases to identify commonalities) and various
            computational approaches, in which large-scale data sets of genetic, protein, cellular, etc. are analyzed to
            find potential similarities. Once a similar rare disease is identified, a rare disease nonprofit
            organization can then pursue a few avenues to learn from their treatment experience:

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Computational approach</h1>

  <p>
    Utilizing AI and machine learning (ML) to identify potential repurposed treatments is a relatively new approach, coming from information and computer science and “big data” computational analysis. It can be done in a variety of ways, which are constantly evolving and improving with the improvement in models, computational abilities. A few of these are:

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Data from off label use approach</h1>

  <p>
    <b> Off-label drug use</b> refers to the use of a drug for a disease that has not been specifically approved by
    regulatory authorities, such as the FDA in the US. It is quite common (citation) and is used in cases where a drug
    has been found to be safe and effective for a new disease through research, or a physician has reason to believe it
    may help a patient from their own medical knowledge or anecdotal reports from other doctors. Additionally, doctors
    may prescribe drugs off-label for the disease which the drug is approved for, but for a different population, such
    as children, pregnant women, or other populations, which were not included in the original clinical trials. This can
    be incredibly helpful for patients that are not responding to the standard of care or have no standard of care for
    their disease. However, off-label use of drugs can also have risks. Since the safety and effectiveness of a drug for
    an off-label use have not been established, there is a potential for adverse events or lack of efficacy.

  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Tracking off-label drug use</b> can provide information on how well the drug works in different populations or
    for different conditions, as preliminary data to more formal research, or in lieu of formal research. Systematic
    tracking of off-label drug use can support its continued use and improve understanding of its effectiveness, as well
    as support the official integration into treatment guidelines.

  </p>

  <p>
    To be able to utilize off-label drug use as an avenue for drug identification, rare disease nonprofits can track
    off-label drug use in their patient populations by implementing a few different strategies:

        published in peer-reviewed journals, and reviewing data from clinical trials and observational studies. This

<p>
      Small animals such as mice, rats, and zebrafish are commonly used in in vivo research. These animals are relatively inexpensive, easy to handle, and have a short lifespan, which allows for the rapid completion of studies. Additionally, many of these animals have genetic similarities to humans, which makes them suitable models for human diseases. It's also possible to use transgenic animals which are genetically modified to carry a disease-causing mutation, these animals are used to study the pathology of the disease and test the drug efficacy.

</p>

<p>
      However, it's important to note that in vivo studies have ethical considerations and are subject to strict regulations. Additionally, results obtained from animal studies may not always be directly translatable to humans, so even drugs which seem promising in animal models may not end up being successful in being repurposed.

  <h1 class="mb-5">Evaluation of RWE</h1>

  <p><b>Real World Evidence (RWE)</b> refers to data collected in routine clinical practice, outside of the controlled
    environment of a clinical trial. This type of evidence can provide valuable information on the safety and
    effectiveness of a drug in a real-world setting, in a broader patient population and with longer follow-up.

    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-8 mt-2">
      <p>
        RWE can come from various sources, such as electronic health records (EHRs), claims data, and patient-reported
        outcomes (PROs). EHRs contain detailed information on patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes,
        and can provide a wealth of information on a drug's safety and effectiveness in real-world settings. Claims
        data, which is collected by insurance providers, can also provide valuable information on a drug's utilization
        and effectiveness. PROs can provide insights into patients' experiences and outcomes and can be used to gather
        information on a drug's impact on quality of life.
      </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      However, in the case of repurposed drugs, there may be limited RWE available, which can make it difficult to
      determine its effectiveness in the patient population of interest. This can be particularly challenging for rare
      diseases, as the patient population is small and the disease may have a different manifestation in different
      patients.

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Clinical trial</h1>
  <p>
    Clinical trials are research studies that are conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of new drugs, medical devices, or other interventions in humans, after preclinical work has been done in cell lines and/or animal models to prove basic efficacy and some basic safety. The clinical trial process is divided into several phases, each of which has a specific purpose and set of objectives.
  </p>

   <p> 
    <b>Phase I clinical trials</b><br>
    These are the first studies in humans. They are usually small, short-term studies that involve a small number of healthy volunteers or patients. The main objectives of Phase I trials are to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes and excretes the drug) of the new intervention.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Phase II clinical trials</b><br>
  These studies involve a larger number of patients and are designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new intervention. The main objectives of Phase II trials are to determine the optimal dosage and to assess the effectiveness of the new drug or device.
  </p>    

  <p>
    <b>Phase III clinical trials</b><br>
  These studies are large, multicenter studies that involve hundreds or thousands of patients. They are designed to provide more robust data on the safety and efficacy of the new intervention, and to compare it to the current standard of care. The main objectives of Phase III trials are to confirm the effectiveness of the new drug or device and to further evaluate its safety profile.
  </p>


<p>
  Though some drug repurposing projects go through all 3 phases, most are able to skip <b>Phase I</b> since basic safety for the drug has already been established in prior research (though if the patient population is very different from the original, sometimes it’s a good idea to start with Phase I trials even for a repurposed drug). In many/some cases, phases II and III can be combined to answer the research questions faster and with less patients. 

</p>

<p>
  After clinical trial completion, there is a submission process for FDA approval. The FDA reviews the data from the clinical trials and decides whether to approve the drug or device for use in the general population. 

</p>

<p>
  Post-approval, <b>Phase IV</b> studies are done after the FDA approves the drug and these studies are called post-marketing studies, which are done to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the drug in the general population. It's important to note that the success rate of drugs in the clinical trials is very low, especially in the later stages of trials. Also, the time and cost of clinical trials are significant, and the process of submitting the application to FDA is very difficult without the support of the pharmaceutical company who owns the drug patent. Even with support, it takes months if not years for the company to put together the documentation packet, which is often several hundred pages long.

</p>

<p>
  As discussed in other sections, there is much complexity in the design, funding, recruitment and management of clinical trials. Here we would like to point out a few clinical trial designs which might be especially useful for repurposing work:

These trials are designed to test a drug's effectiveness in a specific individual and can provide personalized treatment options for that person, as well as provide vital insights into the disease and treatment effectiveness, which then serves as the justification for designing and conducting larger and more expensive trials. This is an especially important option for ultra-rare diseases in which large-scale clinical trials are simply impossible or for rare disease organizations which cannot financially support clinical trials.

  <h1 class="mb-5">Off label use</h1>

  <p>
    <b>Off-label drug use</b> refers to the use of a drug for a disease that has not been specifically approved by
    regulatory authorities, such as the FDA in the US. It is quite common (citation) and is used in cases where a drug
    has been found to be safe and effective for a new disease through research, or a physician has reason to believe it
    may help a patient from their own medical knowledge or anecdotal reports from other doctors. Additionally, doctors
    may prescribe drugs off-label for the disease which the drug is approved for, but for a different population, such
    as children, pregnant women, or other populations, which were not included in the original clinical trials. This can
    be incredibly helpful for patients that are not responding to the standard of care or have no standard of care for
    their disease. However, off-label use of drugs can also have risks. Since the safety and effectiveness of a drug for
    an off-label use have not been established, there is a potential for adverse events or lack of efficacy.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">
      <p>
        In the context of clinical use during a drug repurposing project, off label use is an alternative to clinical
        trials if the latter are not feasible due to costs, patient size, lack of researcher or pharma support, etc.
        This is why it’s so important for a rare disease nonprofit to have infrastructure, whether informal such as a
        patient survey or a formalized natural history study, to be able to capture and track off label drug use. This
        will enable the nonprofit to not only be able to have a list of all drugs being prescribed or taken OTC for
        their rare disease of focus, but also track their effectiveness and side effects over time. This can be vital
        data to provide to researchers, and can be a stepping stone to more formal research, such as clinical trials, in
        the future.

  <h1 class="mb-5">Approvals</h1>

  <p>
    <b>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</b> is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and
    Human Services that is responsible for ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs,
    biological products, and medical devices. It does not regulate vitamins and other supplements. The FDA is also
    responsible for ensuring that these products are accurately labeled and that they meet the standards set by the
    federal government.
  </p>

  <p>
    The FDA plays a critical role in the approval of drugs in the United States. The process of getting a drug approved
    by the FDA is a multi-step process that can take several years to complete. It begins with preclinical studies,
    which are conducted in the laboratory and in animal models. If the results of these studies are promising, the drug
    can then be tested in clinical trials, which are conducted in human volunteers. Once the preclinical studies are
    completed and the drug is validated in clinical studies, the drug sponsor (usually a pharmaceutical company) submits
    an application to the FDA for approval. The FDA then reviews the data from the preclinical and clinical studies, as
    well as other information about the drug, such as its chemical composition and how it is manufactured. If the FDA
    determines that the drug is safe and effective, it can approve the drug for marketing in the United States. The FDA
    also plays a role in monitoring the safety of drugs once they are on the market. The agency can issue safety
    warnings, require post-marketing studies, or even withdraw a drug from the market if it is found to be unsafe.

  </p>

  <p>
    For <b>drug repurposing</b>, the FDA must review and approve the new use of the drug. This process typically
    involves a new drug application (NDA) or a supplemental NDA (sNDA) which must be submitted by the sponsor (usually a
    pharmaceutical company). The FDA will review the data from preclinical and clinical studies, as well as other
    information about the drug, such as its chemical composition and how it is manufactured.

  </p>

  <p>The FDA has special provisions in place to expedite the development and approval of drugs for rare diseases, also
    known as orphan diseases, which are defined as diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.
    These provisions are intended to encourage the development of treatments for these diseases, which may not be as
    profitable as treatments for more common diseases.

      <p>
        A citizen's petition is a formal request submitted to the FDA by an individual or
        organization, asking the agency to take a specific action related to the regulation of a drug or device. Anyone
        can submit a citizen's petition, including patients, patient advocacy groups, physicians, and industry groups.
        The FDA is required by law to respond to citizen's petitions within 150 days. In its response, the FDA can agree
        with the request, deny the request, or take other actions such as requesting additional information or
        conducting further studies. Citizen's petitions can be used to request a wide range of actions from the FDA,
        such as requesting that the FDA approve a new drug, withdraw an existing drug from the market, or change the
        labeling of a drug. Citizen's petitions can also be used to request the FDA to take action on drug repurposing.
        For example, a patient advocacy group may submit a citizen's petition asking the FDA to approve a drug for a new
        indication, or a pharmaceutical company may submit a citizen's petition asking the FDA to change the labeling of
        a drug to include a new indication. Source        </p>

  <p>
    It's important to note that the FDA's approval process for drugs for rare diseases can be complex, and the agency
    may require additional data and information before approving a drug. Also, historically drug repurposing projects
    that do not have support of the pharmaceutical company who owns the drug patent or was the original patent holder
    have not been successful in being able to support FDA approval submissions due to the costs and documentation
    requirements necessary. Additionally, FDA's role is to ensure the safety and efficacy of the drugs, which means that
    even if a drug is approved for a rare disease, it may not be covered by insurance or accessible to all patients.

  <p>In our ROADMAP survey data, only 6 drugs (out of our 94 total or 76 unique) drugs, have made it to FDA approval:

    Looking closer at these 6 organizations, which have had a drug make it to FDA approval through drug repurposing,
    they are on average <b>26.7</b> years old (range: <b>11-44</b>); their annual funding ranged from <b>$100,000</b> to
    <b>more than $5,000,000</b> (the most common selection was <b>between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000</b>); and they have
    the following characteristics: <b>all 6</b> have an SAB/MAB, <b>1</b> has a biobank, <b>4</b> have a natural history
    study, <b>2</b> have a patient registry, and <b>3</b> already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug
    repurposing. A testament to the dedication of their volunteers in the pursuit of success, one of these organizations
    has no full time staff, relying entirely on volunteer or part-time staff to achieve their success, while the other
    five have anywhere from <b>1</b> to <b>40</b> full time staff.

  <h2>Subjectively-reported success
    
  </h2>

<p>
  One way to conceptualize success in drug repurposing is through a subjective assessment of whether the drug has helped achieve a significant effect on something that is important to patients, outside of official FDA approval, such as:

</p>

<p>
  Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms
Significant improvement in quality of life 
Increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality
Provide cure of disease
Provide prevention of relapse

</p>

<p>
  Because it is difficult to qualify what is a “significant” reduction or improvement without formal data with a clinical trial, these measures are open to various biases and inaccuracies due to this subjective nature. Nevertheless, we felt that it was important to calculate how many organizations in our data felt that they have reached one or more of these endpoints. Not only to be able to capture a wider variety of success definitions for the sake of the projects themselves, but also to engage with a more patient-centric definition of success, as there are things that are important to patients, which may not be prioritized from a research perspective or measured as a part of a clinical trial. 

</p>

<p>
  If we utilize the criteria of counting an organization as “successful” if they have met at least one subjectively-reported success endpoint for at least one drug, and counting all other organizations as “not yet successful”, we end up with <b>13</b> successful and <b>45</b> not yet successful organizations. Looking closer at the <b>13</b> successful organizations, they are on average <b>18.31</b> years old (range: <b>2-44</b>); the majority (<b>4 organizations</b>, 30.77%) reported an annual funding <b>between $100,000 and $500,00</b>; and they have the following characteristics: <b>12</b> (92.31%) have an SAB, <b>5</b> (38.46%) have a biobank, <b>8</b> (61.54%) have a natural history study, <b>8</b> (61.54%) have a formal research agenda, <b>7</b> (53.85%) have a patient registry, and <b>5</b> (38.46) already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing (one organization has two FDA-approved drugs).  <b>6</b> (46.15%) have no full time  staff, relying entirely on volunteer and/or part-time  labor to achieve their success.

</p>

<p>
  Among these <b>13</b> subjectively “successful” organizations, there are <b>45</b> unique drugs being repurposed. The most common drugs among these organizations were <b>Sirolimus</b> (<b>4 organizations</b>) and <b>Trametinib/Everolimus/Dupilumab/Bevacizumab</b> (<b>2 organizations each</b>). The most common identification method for these drugs was <b>Preclinical/Translational research (31)</b>, closely followed by <b>data from similar diseases (20)</b> and <b>off-label use (17)</b>. Most of these drugs are currently in early stages, specifically the <b>recruiting patients for clinical trials (18)</b> stage. Their respective rare diseases have the following characteristics: <b>8</b> (61.54%) have treatment guidelines, <b>9</b> (69.23%) have an identified genetic mutation, <b>9</b> (69.23%) have an ICD code, <b>13</b> (100%) have animal models, <b>1</b> (76.92%) have cell lines developed, <b>4</b> (30.77%) have predictive biomarkers and <b>6</b> (46.15%) have a clear understanding of etiology or disease pathogenesis.
