  <h1 class = "mb-5">Data from off label use approach</h1>

  <p>
    <b> Off-label drug use</b> refers to the use of a drug for a disease that has not been specifically approved by
    regulatory authorities, such as the FDA in the US. It is quite common (citation) and is used in cases where a drug
    has been found to be safe and effective for a new disease through research, or a physician has reason to believe it
    may help a patient from their own medical knowledge or anecdotal reports from other doctors. Additionally, doctors
    may prescribe drugs off-label for the disease which the drug is approved for, but for a different population, such
    as children, pregnant women, or other populations, which were not included in the original clinical trials. This can
    be incredibly helpful for patients that are not responding to the standard of care or have no standard of care for
    their disease. However, off-label use of drugs can also have risks. Since the safety and effectiveness of a drug for
    an off-label use have not been established, there is a potential for adverse events or lack of efficacy.

  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Tracking off-label drug use</b> can provide information on how well the drug works in different populations or
    for different conditions, as preliminary data to more formal research, or in lieu of formal research. Systematic
    tracking of off-label drug use can support its continued use and improve understanding of its effectiveness, as well
    as support the official integration into treatment guidelines.

  <p>
    To be able to utilize off-label drug use as an avenue for drug identification, rare disease nonprofits can track
    off-label drug use in their patient populations by implementing a few different strategies:

      <p><b>Surveys and questionnaires</b></p>
      <p>
        Surveys and questionnaires can be used to gather information from patients and caregivers about their experiences
    with off-label drug use. These surveys can be distributed through the nonprofit's website, social media, or mailing
    list, and can include questions about the types of drugs being used, the reasons for off-label use, and the outcomes
    of treatment.

      <p><b>Natural history registries</b></p>
      <p>
        Registries can be used to collect and track information about patients with a specific rare disease, including
    information about the treatments that patients are receiving and its effects (and side effects) over time.

      <p><b>Collaboration with healthcare providers</b></p>
      <p>
        Nonprofits can collaborate with healthcare providers to gather information about off-label drug use in their patient
        populations in order to identify trends and patterns in off-label drug use.

      <p><b>Literature review</b></p>
      <p> 
        Nonprofits can help conduct literature reviews of existing studies and publications to identify information about
        off-label drug use in their patient populations. This can include searching for articles and studies that have been
        published in peer-reviewed journals, and reviewing data from clinical trials and observational studies. This
        information can then be provided to the researcher’s in the nonprofits’ network to evaluate whether any of the drugs
        are promising enough to pursue.

  <p>
    Among our 147 organizations, 17/147 (11.56%) track off-label drug use of their patient populations. This includes 16/111 (14.41%) of the organizations that support research and 12/58 (20.69%) of those that are pursuing drug repurposing. Looking at our successful organizations, 2/6 (33.33%) of the organizations who have had a drug FDA approved and 5/13 (38.46%) of organizations which have reached a “subjective” success endpoint track off-label drug use. 
  </p>


  <p>
    Looking at off-label drugs is a drug identification method for drug repurposing, and was utilized __#__ (___%) in the projects in our data. Out of the 17 organizations that track off label drugs, ___#_/__% of them utilized this data in an ongoing drug repurposing project as a drug identification method. 

  </p>

  <p>
    Though these are all correlational relationships, it does suggest that tracking off label drug use in your patient population, either informally through simple patient surveys or systematically through a natural history study, can be helpful in identifying potentially helpful drugs for a rare disease.
