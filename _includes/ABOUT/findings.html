    <b>State of rare disease nonprofits in the US & drug repurposing    </b><br>
    From our crowdsourcing initiative, we identified 711 rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US. In the last 10 years there has been an explosion in the number of new rare disease nonprofit organizations, with over 56% of them being founded from 2011-2021. Interestingly, 416 (41.9%) of the organizations were started by loved ones of patients (parents, spouses, siblings, etc.) and 206 (20.8%) were started by the patients themselves. Out of the 711,

    <p>
        Utilizing the organization’s websites, our team of extractors identified how many stated that they utilize certain resources that may be important for an organization to be able to successfully support research projects in the future, such as:

    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            a biobank - 142 (20%) organizations

        </li>
        <li>
            a natural history registry or study - 291 (41%) organizations

        </li>
        <li>
            a SAB/MAB  - 423 (59.5%) organizations

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Interestingly for this project, our team found mentions of drug repurposing initiatives, off label use or treatment guidelines that included repurposed drugs among 135 (19%) organizations. Only 335 (47%) organizations had a formalized research agenda, while 234 (33%) mentioned formalized treatment guidelines for their rare disease of focus. 430 (60.5%) focus on a single rare disease and its subtypes, while 264 focus on multiple rare diseases (some organizations were very broad, focusing on either all rare diseases or both rare and common diseases).

        <b>UpToDate dataset: Potential of Off Label Use        </b><br>
        The team of extractors extracted a total of 1,054 (542 unique) drugs for 68 rare diseases (while we started with 100 diseases, this number reduced due to combination of subtypes for the same rare disease and elimination of diseases which do not meet the official criteria for being considered “rare”). 926 drugs were listed as recommended or potentially helpful, 53 were not recommended. 702 (71.7%) were FDA approved for the rare disease in question, 203 (20.7%) were being utilized off-label, and 74 (7.6%) were not yet approved for anything in the US. Per rare disease, 304 (25.7%) unique drugs were recommended but either off label or not yet approved for anything in the US, which illustrates just how common off label drug use is and how huge the potential for drug repurposing is.

        <b>Survey insights: Rare Disease Nonprofits         </b><br>
        According to the data, out of 147 organizations, 127 support research, 58 are pursuing drug repurposing projects and 58 are not yet, but are interested in doing so. Out of the 58 which are pursuing drug repurposing (though only 40 organizations have provided a specific drug of focus), 15 have successfully met at least one endpoint. Only 6 drugs have made it to FDA approval, though it is worth mentioning that only 40 (43%) of drug repurposing projects in our data set FDA approval as their success endpoint goal. The most popular success endpoints selected were “Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms” (50 - 10 met), “Drug to provide significant improvement in quality of life” (50 - 8 met), and “Drug to be freely available to patients off label with safety / efficacy data” (47 - 2 met). This speaks to the need to have a broader definition of “success” other than FDA approval. 
    
    </p>

    <p>
        58 organizations are pursuing or have pursued drug repurposing projects in the past. 19 organizations have stated that they have pursued multiple drug repurposing projects, with an average of 3.84 projects per organization (range of 2-7), though most organizations only pursued two projects at a time. Out of the 58 organizations that are pursuing drug repurposing projects (or have in the past), only 17 systematically track off label drug use in their patient population. This is important to highlight since off-label data analysis was the third top drug identification method in our data, leading 14 organizations to identify 25 as promising for their rare diseases. 65.45% stated that they are interested in tracking this information in the future. 

    </p>


<p>
    Let’s now look closer at the 94 (76 unique) drugs which are in process of being repurposed by 40 organizations in our data. As discussed prior, we separated the timeline of a drug repurposing project into several stages:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Early stage: Securing funding, testing existing drugs in mouse or other animal models, trying to secure researcher interest to pursue, patient data collection, recruiting patients for clinical trials)

    </li>
    <li>
        Clinical trials: stage I, II, III clinical trials or analyzing clinical trial data 

    </li>
    <li>
        Late stage: submitting clinical trial data to FDA

    </li>
    <li>
        Endpoint:<br>
FDA approval
an alternative success endpoint (use of drug off label)
a subjective success endpoint (Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms, significant improvement in quality of life, increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality, provide cure of disease, provide prevention of relapse)
unsuccessful (project abandoned or FDA approval denied). 

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In our dataset, 28 drugs are in early stages, 27 - in clinical trials, 13 - in late stages. As mentioned earlier, only 6 drugs have so far made it to FDA approval for their new rare disease indication and many (21) have reached either an alternative or subjective outcome, meaning they are being used off label and having some sort of positive effect on the patients despite not having official FDA approval. 

</p>

<p>
    The most common drug identification method was preclinical/translational research (65 drugs). The other top choices were looking at drugs used in similar diseases (28), off-label use data analysis (24), high throughput drug screening (HTDS) (21) and literature review/meta-analysis (16). The least popular option was machine learning/artificial intelligence approaches (2), which may speak to the novelty of this approach and its slow integration into the existing research/repurposing processes or that it is mostly being utilized without the involvement of rare disease nonprofit organizations. It is also important to mention that 57 drugs utilized more than one identification method. The most common combination of methods was HTDS and Preclinical/Translational research (11 cases) and looking at drugs used in similar diseases and Preclinical/Translational (9 cases). This speaks to the value of pursuing multiple avenues at once and triangulating the findings from one method with another. It is also interesting to point out that the 11 drugs were identified as promising in different ways for different rare diseases.

</p>

<p>
    It is very interesting that the second top choice was looking at drugs used in similar diseases, as one of our research focuses was the levels of collaboration between different organizations, and we were specifically interested to see how much collaboration we would see among different rare disease nonprofits. 

</p>

<p>
    With the data from the collaboration section of the survey, we were able to build networks. Each node in a network represents an organization, and each edge signifying a connection between them, either an explicitly mentioned connection via the survey data or an affiliation edge which was later added by the research team. The nodes are colored by type of organization, with a distinction made between our participating rare disease nonprofit organizations, and other nonprofit organizations mentioned by the respondents:

    <img class = "img-fluid shadow-3-strong" src = "{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/about/network-node.png"/>
    <figcaption>network node color legend

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    From looking at the network visualization, we can see that most of the rare disease nonprofit organizations in our data are actually part of one large “connected component”. A connected component means that there is a path between every pair of nodes. In other words, it is a group of nodes that are all reachable from one another by following the edges of the graph. The nodes here are sized by degree, with the largest two nodes being NORD and Global Genes, which is not surprising since these are large, umbrella organizations which each have hundreds of member organizations.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Additionally, since we asked organizations about the types of collaborations they are engaged in with their top 5 closest collaborators, we are able to view subsets of the networks based on the type of activity. For example, we can see that between organizations who share data, share resources and share knowledge about their experiences there is some overlap within the network, but there are some significant differences: knowledge sharing seems to be a lot more common overall and mostly between our rare disease nonprofit organizations (colored orange) and other nonprofit organizations (colored light blue), whereas data and resource sharing seems to be much more common between our rare disease nonprofit organizations (colored orange) and university/research centers (colored light green) and hospitals (colored brown).

    <p>
        Though many people equate drug repurposing with high throughput drug screening (HTDS), there are some concerns with how expensive HTDS projects can be and how much success they yield at the end (citation?). In our data, 21 drugs were identified via high throughput drug screens. 6 are still in early stages, 7 are in clinical trials, 4 are in late stages, while only 2 made it to FDA approval. 3 have made it to an alternative success outcome, while 6 have reached one of our “subjective” success outcomes, and 3 have been unsuccessful. 

    </p>

    <p>
        There are many ways we can conceptualize “success” in a drug repurposing project. One obvious and traditional marker is receiving FDA approval. Out of our 94 (76 unique) drugs, only 6 have made it to FDA approval: 

    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Dupilumab // Campaign Urging Research for Eosinophilic Disease // Eosinophilic diseases

        </li>
        <li>
            Selumetinib // Children's Tumor Foundation // Neurofibromatosis

        </li>
        <li>
            Alpelisib // CLOVES Syndrome Community // CLOVES syndrome

        </li>
        <li>
            Rituximab // International Pemphigus Pemphigoid Foundation // Pemphigus, Pemphigoid

        </li>
        <li>
            Sirolimus // LAM Foundation // Lymphangioleiomyomatosis

        </li>
        <li>
            Pazopanib // Cure HHT (NOTE - “Received FDA Breakthrough designation,” not FDA approval) // Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia

        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Looking closer at these 6 organizations, which have had a drug make it to FDA approval through drug repurposing, they are on average 26.7 years old (range: 11  - 44); their annual funding ranged from $100,000  to more than $5,000,000 (the most common selection was “$1,000,000 and $2,000,000”); and they have the following characteristics: all 6 have an SAB/MAB, 1 has a biobank, 4 have a natural history study, 4 have a formal research agenda, 2  have a patient registry, and 3 already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing. A testament to the dedication of their volunteers in the pursuit of success, one of these organizations has no full time staff, relying entirely on volunteer or part-time staff to achieve their success, while the other five have anywhere from 1 to 40 full time staff. 

    </p>

    <p>
        It is important to note that there are very many factors that affect whether a drug can ever get FDA approval that do not depend on its safety, efficacy and are beyond the control of a researcher or a rare disease nonprofit organization supporting a drug repurposing project. Notably the most important of these is the drug’s patent status, which affects the level of interest by a pharmaceutical company to invest time and money into supporting the FDA approval application. Thus, we consider FDA approval as not the best success metric if we consider that the most important outcome is getting treatments to rare disease patients with enough efficacy and safety data. 

    </p>

    <p>
        If we utilize the criteria of counting an organization as “successful” if they have met at least one subjectively-reported success endpoint (Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms, significant improvement in quality of life, increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality, provide cure of disease, provide prevention of relapse) for at least one drug, and counting all other organizations as “not yet successful”, we end up with 13 successful and 45 not yet successful organizations. Looking closer at the 13 successful organizations, they are on average 18.31 years old (range: 2-44); the majority (4 organizations, 30.77%) reported an annual funding between $100,000 and $500,00; and they have the following characteristics: 12 (92.31%) have an SAB, 5 (38.46%) have a biobank, 8 (61.54%) have a natural history study, 8 (61.54%) have a formal research agenda, 7 (53.85%) have a patient registry, and 5 (38.46) already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing (one organization has two FDA-approved drugs).  6 (46.15%) have no full time  staff, relying entirely on volunteer and/or part-time  labor to achieve their success.

    </p>

    <p>
        Among these 13 subjectively “successful” organizations, there are 45 unique drugs being repurposed. The most common drugs among these organizations were Sirolimus (4 organizations) and Trametinib/Everolimus/Dupilumab/Bevacizumab (2 organizations each). The most common identification method for these drugs was Preclinical/Translational research (31), closely followed by data from similar diseases (20) and off-label use (17). Most of these drugs are currently in early stages, specifically the recruiting patients for clinical trials (18) stage. Their respective rare diseases have the following characteristics: 8 (61.54%) have treatment guidelines, 9 (69.23%) have an identified genetic mutation, 9 (69.23%) have an ICD code, 13 (100%) have animal models, 10 (76.92%) have cell lines developed, 4 (30.77%) have predictive biomarkers and 6 (46.15%) have a clear understanding of etiology or disease pathogenesis.

    <b>Survey insights: Patients & Loved ones    </b><br>
    For rare disease patients and their loved ones (these stakeholders received the same set of questions) we were interested in their experience with off label drugs for their rare disease, including roadblocks in access, as well as their general attitude towards and comfort level with drug repurposing. 

</p>

<p>
    Generally, it seems that patients are not clearly aware of whether the drugs they are taking are FDA approved or off label, as 28.8% stated they are not aware of the status of the drug that they are on.

</p>

<p>
    Most patients (76.6%)  have heard of the term “off label” but have not talked to their doctor about using an off label drug, nor are most of these patients  (66.5%) aware of other patients using off label drugs. Generally, patients are very willing to follow their doctor's recommendations based on trust with their doctor, as well as drug safety and efficacy. Most patients (strictly among those who said they received the survey from one of the 58 rare disease non profits that reported being involved in drug repurposing)  were not aware of the term drug repurposing and are not aware of any initiatives being done for their rare disease, [this may include patients from organizations which are currently supporting drug repurposing projects]. They stated that they were extremely interested in it based on the definition we provided in the survey. The most important aspect that interested patients was having more treatment options available and strongly agreed to the idea that drug repurposing is generally safe and necessary for their rare disease. Generally, patients reported little to no roadblocks in drug access, which is great to see, as roadblocks such as insurance not approving off-label drugs can greatly affect patient access to potentially life-saving treatment, even if the drug repurposing process has been successful. 

</p>

<p>
    So, overall, it seems that the patients and loved ones who participated in the survey have a positive attitude towards drug repurposing, but lack a deep understanding of what is being done for their disease and what off label drugs are promising or being pursued. This can be useful for rare disease nonprofits to be aware of in crafting their communication materials, to make sure that their patient populations are aware of all the research being pursued and all treatment options available with sufficient safety and efficacy data, even if they are not yet FDA-approved for their rare disease.

    <b>Survey insights: Physicians </b><br>
    For physicians, we were mainly interested in the frequency and ​factors taken into consideration when deciding to prescribe a drug off-label, off-label drug prescription practices for the rare diseases they treat, as well as their levels of involvement in clinical trials for rare diseases. 

</p>

<p>
    Due to the low number of physicians who participated in the survey (only 23), it is difficult to make any generalizations based on the data. But, at least the physicians in our dataset, 70.6% of them were aware of off label drug options for the rare diseases that they treat and they prescribe them often. They stated they were “somewhat effective” at both reducing overall symptoms, preventing worsening of the patients’ rare disease and improving your patients’ overall state of health. 80% of the physicians stated that the current off label options do not completely address all of the challenges associated with your patients’ rare disease.

<p>
    The participating physicians were familiar with drug repurposing, were aware of ongoing clinical trials and have previously referred eligible patients to them. 100% of our participating physicians stated that, if the opportunity presented itself, they would be willing to be a co-investigator on a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a drug that is being repurposed for a rare disease that they treat.

    <b>Survey insights: Researchers    </b><br>
    For researchers, we asked questions regarding their involvement in research projects to advance drug repurposing for any rare diseases, what their motivations are and what challenges they’ve encountered. 

</p>

<p>
    We had 43 researchers participate in the ROADMAP survey, and most of them stated that they are extremely interested in drug repurposing and find it extremely important. Those that have done research related to drug repurposing in the past or are currently, which was 31 (96.9%) researchers, said that their top motivation is its impact to patients. Their top difficulties were lack of funding, lack of collaboration/support from a pharmaceutical company and lack of biospecimens. Importantly, 86.1% of the researchers said that they engage with the rare disease patient population in the research process.
