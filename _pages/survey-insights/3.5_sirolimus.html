    <h1>Organizations repurposing Sirolimus</h1>
    <p class="pt-4 pb-0">
        Both from anecdotal evidence from conversations, rare disease research events and our ROADMAP survey data, we can see that sirolimus (Rapamyacin) is a very commonly repurposed drug. This is because it has demonstrated efficacy in a number of medical conditions beyond its original intended use, which was as an immunosuppressive drug after organ transplantation. It has been found to have antiproliferative effects on certain types of cells, such as smooth muscle cells and cancer cells, and has been studied for its potential use in treating cancer, atherosclerosis, and even to prevent aging. Additionally, its relatively low toxicity and well-established safety profile make it an attractive candidate for repurposing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through various sources, we have identified that as many as 17 rare disease nonprofit organizations are in various stages of repurposing it for their patient population, whether it's supporting off label use, funding preclinical research or supporting clinical trials.
    </p>


    <p>
        Through the ROADMAP project, we spoke to 9 of these organizations and have their permission to share the following data. <b> If you are interested in repurposing sirolimus for your rare disease, reaching out to these or other organizations that are exploring the role of mTOR inhibitors may be beneficial in terms of data sharing and collaboration.</b>

                                    CD is a group of rare disorders that involve enlarged lymph nodes and a broad range of inflammatory symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. In CD, the cells of the immune system become hyperactivated, overproduce cytokines and other inflammatory compounds, and fail to return to a surveillance mode.
