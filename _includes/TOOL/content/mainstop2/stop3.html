      <h1 class="mb-5">Data from similar diseases approach</h1>

      <p>
            Rare disease nonprofit organizations can identify promising drugs for repurposing by researching drugs that
            have been developed for similar diseases. They also collaborate with other organizations and researchers in
            order to share information and pool resources for drug development. Even though rare diseases can be complex
            and vary greatly even between patients and subtypes of the same rare disease, there are various ways to find
            opportunities for collaboration and similarities which may be helpful in identifying promising treatments.
            If the similarities between the different rare diseases are not yet known, they can be identified through
            genomic analysis (studying the genetic makeup of patients with different rare diseases to identify common
            genetic mutations or variations that may indicate an overlap), phenotypic analysis (studying the observable
            characteristics or symptoms of patients with different rare diseases to identify commonalities) and various
            computational approaches, in which large-scale data sets of genetic, protein, cellular, etc. are analyzed to
            find potential similarities. Once a similar rare disease is identified, a rare disease nonprofit
            organization can then pursue a few avenues to learn from their treatment experience:

                        If the similar disease has an active nonprofit that supports research or tracks off label drug
                        use, collaborations can be established to share information and resources to identify overlaps which
                        could benefit both populations. Direct organization-organization collaboration may uncover other types
                        of knowledge which is not often published in literature or other official sources, such as their
                        drug repurposing experience and struggles, anecdotal evidence of certain off label treatments being
                        promising, some unusual disease symptoms or drug side effects which are still unexplained, etc.

            Looking at drugs used in similar diseases was the second top choice of drug identification methods for drug
            repurposing projects in our data (<b>28 drugs</b>). This is very interesting as we have highlighted the
            great value of cross-rare disease and cross-organizational collaboration in overcoming various challenges in
            the drug repurposing process. <b>2</b> of these drugs are still in early stages, <b>9</b> are in clinical
            trials, <b>6</b> are in late stages, <b>3</b> made it to FDA approval. <b>8</b> have made it to an
            alternative success outcome, while <b>9</b> have reached one of our “subjective” success outcomes, and
            <b>4</b> have been unsuccessful.
