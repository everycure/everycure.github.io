      <p>
            Rare disease nonprofit organizations can identify promising drugs for repurposing by researching drugs that are used for similar diseases. Genomic analyses (studying the genetic makeup of patients with different rare diseases to identify common genetic mutations or variations that may indicate an overlap), phenotypic analysis (studying the observable characteristics or symptoms of patients with different rare diseases to identify commonalities) and various computational approaches, in which large-scale data sets of genetic, protein, cellular, etc. are analyzed can help to find potential similarities between diseases that may benefit from the same drug.

                        Looking at drugs used in similar diseases was the second most common choice of drug identification methods for drug repurposing projects (<b>29</b> drugs). This is very interesting as it highlights the potential value of cross-rare disease and cross-organizational collaboration. <b>2</b> of these drugs are still in early stages, <b>9</b> are in clinical trials, <b>6</b> are in late stages, and <b>3</b> have made it to FDA approval. <b>8</b> are being used off label with some measure of benefit, and <b>4</b> have been unsuccessful.

            Once a similar rare disease is identified, a rare disease nonprofit organization can pursue a few avenues to learn from their treatment experience to identify potential repurposing opportunities for their rare disease:

                        Reading up on all the research on the similar rare disease, to see if any treatments have been proposed but not yet pursued through translational research

            <div class="col-10">
                  <p>
                        <b>Other rare disease nonprofit organizations</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        If the similar disease has an active nonprofit that supports research or tracks off-label drug use, collaborations can be established to share information and resources to identify overlaps which could benefit both populations. Direct organization-organization collaboration may uncover other types of knowledge which is not often published in literature or other official sources, such as their drug repurposing experience and struggles, anecdotal evidence of certain off-label treatments being promising, some unusual disease symptoms or drug side effects which are still unexplained, etc.

                  <p>
                        If the similar disease has researchers that are actively pursuing translational work, forming collaborations with them may benefit a rare disease nonprofitâ€™s researcher knowledge base and network, by providing a new perspective and insights from similar diseases.
