    <h1>Researchers</h1>
    <p>
        As a part of the ROADMAP project participation, we asked the rare disease nonprofits to forward the survey to their US-based researcher network and invite them to take the survey. Wee asked questions regarding the researchers’ involvement in research projects to advance drug repurposing for any rare diseases, what their motivations are and what challenges they’ve encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the sample size of participating researchers was small (43), we present the data as an initial reference for understanding their involvement in different aspects of drug repurposing initiatives. Making broad generalizations as to researchers whose research relates to rare disease drug repurposing based on this data may be challenging based on the small sample size.

                For purposes of this project, we utilized a broad definition of drug repurposing, as a process of research to identify potential treatments that are already FDA-approved or in development for one disease, for use in another disease by gathering data and analyzing efficacy in order to improve treatment guidelines and access.

                Among those researchers that reported to be directly involved in the dissemination of this information to the rare disease community, most (8, 80%) reported accomplishing this task by working with a rare disease nonprofit organization, though social media and traditional media outlets are also utilized to a lesser extent.

                        A promising finding is that most (30, 83.3%) of researchers in our data reported engaging the rare disease patient population at least in some stage of their research process. Patients bring unique perspectives and insights into their conditions, which can inform research priorities and improve the relevance and quality of research outcomes.
