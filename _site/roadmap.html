            There are ∼7000 rare diseases affecting approximately 30,000,000 individuals in the U.S.A. and 95% of these rare diseases do not have a single Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy. Since the incentives for new drug development for rare diseases are limited, drug repurposing provides a promising way to identify effective treatments for rare diseases faster and cheaper than developing new drugs. Still, many challenges exist in the drug repurposing space.

                                Drug identification is considered the first step in the process of drug repurposing. It involves identifying existing drugs that may have the potential to treat a particular rare disease. This can be done through various methods. We believe the most systematic ones can be separated into five categories:

                        In our data, we have 94 (76 unique) drugs which are in process of being repurposed by 40 organizations. The most common drug identification method was preclinical/translational research (65 drugs). The other top choices were looking at drugs used in similar diseases (28), off-label use data analysis (24), high throughput drug screening (HTDS) (21) and literature review/meta-analysis (16). The least popular option was machine learning/artificial intelligence approaches (2), which may speak to the novelty of this approach and its slow integration into the existing research/repurposing processes or that it is mostly being utilized without the involvement of rare disease nonprofit organizations. 

                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Benefits of multiple methods


                    </h4>
<p>
    These methods of drug identification can be done simultaneously or in sequence, depending on the organization's resources and priorities. For example, an organization may choose to conduct a literature review to gather initial information on potential drug candidates, and then use computational methods to further narrow down the list of candidates. High-throughput screening can then be used as a final validation step to confirm the effectiveness of the identified drugs, or narrow the list done from several promising “hits”. Using multiple methods overall increases the chances of success in the drug repurposing process, as it could also save time and resources by avoiding testing drugs in later stages, which are not as likely to be effective.

</p>


<p>
    In our data, 57 drugs utilized more than one identification method. The most common combination of methods was HTDS and Preclinical/Translational research (11 cases) and looking at drugs used in similar diseases and Preclinical/Translational (9 cases). This speaks to the value of pursuing multiple avenues at once and triangulating the findings from one method with another. It is also interesting to point out that the 11 drugs were identified as promising in different ways for different rare diseases.

                        The validation stage of drug repurposing is a crucial step in determining whether a drug candidate is safe and effective in treating a specific rare disease. This stage typically involves conducting additional studies, prior to moving forward with clinical trials. This stage can be separated into in vivo and in vitro studies, as well as preliminary validation through real-world evidence. Once the validation stage is completed, the organization can move forward with clinical trials to gather more robust data on the drug's safety and efficacy in human subjects with the rare disease.

                    <p>
                        Once the drug is shown to be promising and preliminarily safe and effective, it must be tested in humans before being submitted to FDA for approval or integrated into treatment guidelines. This is traditionally done either through clinical trial testing and/or real world off-label use tracking. Clinical trials provide robust data on the drug's safety and efficacy in human subjects with the disease, and are necessary for obtaining FDA approval and making the drug available to patients, while off-label use tracking can provide additional data on the safety and efficacy of the drug in real-world settings.

                    <p>
                        There are many ways we can conceptualize “success” in a drug repurposing project. One obvious and traditional marker is receiving FDA approval, but it is important to note that there are very many factors that affect whether a drug can ever get FDA approval that do not depend on its safety, efficacy and are beyond the control of a researcher or a rare disease nonprofit organization supporting a drug repurposing project. Notably the most important of these is the drug’s patent status, which affects the level of interest by a pharmaceutical company to invest time and money into supporting the FDA approval application. Thus, we consider FDA approval as not the best success metric if we consider that the most important outcome is getting treatments to rare disease patients with enough efficacy and safety data, thus we can consider what alternative definitions of success can be used to evaluate the outcome of a drug repurposing project, as well as when it should be considered as abandoned.

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Drug screen approach</h1>

    <p>
      High-throughput drug  screening (HTDS) is a method of rapidly screening anywhere from 100,000 to 1,000,0000 of compounds from existing libraries to identify those that have a specific biological activity at the model organism, cellular, pathway, or molecular level. This process is used in early stages of drug discovery to identify potential drug candidates and in drug repurposing to identify new potential uses for existing drugs. The goal of HTDS is to identify active compounds from a library of potential candidates as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Compounds that affect the target in an anticipated way are called hits, and the screens may be restricted to compounds that have already been tested in humans, thereby reducing the need for extensive preclinical tests. These hit compounds become candidates for the starting point for the development of drugs. A HTDS can produce a huge number of hits which are then further optimized and validated to remove any artifacts or ‘noise’ from the screen through further validation testing. The validated hits are studied reducing the number of compounds which then are entered into a lead optimization step to yield a drug candidate to study in clinical trials.

    </p>

    <p>One important aspect of HTDS that is important to consider is that it can be quite expensive, as it requires access to a highly specialized screening facility and compound libraries which many labs may not be able to afford, though there are third-party providers like Contract Research Organizations (CRO) or core facilities which may reduces costs for nonprofits.

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Pathogenesis targeting approach</h1>

  <p>
    <b>Pathogenesis targeting</b> refers to the process of identifying and targeting the underlying biological mechanisms or
    "pathways" that cause a disease. By understanding the pathogenesis of a disease, researchers can identify key
    molecules or processes that are involved in the disease process, and develop therapies that target these specific
    pathways. This could involve identifying the specific genetic mutations, immune cells, pathways or other changes
    that lead to the development and progression of a disease, and identifying existing therapies that target these
    changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the context of drug repurposing, the pathogenesis-targeting approach is a strategy that focuses on identifying
    drugs that target the underlying biological mechanisms of a disease, rather than focusing on the symptoms. This
    approach can be used to repurpose drugs that have already been approved for other indications, by identifying drugs
    that target the underlying mechanisms of a rare disease.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, the CDCN uncovered that over activation of mTOR was important to the pathogenesis of Castleman disease
    and then found an approved mTOR inhibitor that it began testing on patients. More about this story <a href="https://cdcn.org/repurposecd/" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <h1 class="mb-5">Data from similar diseases approach</h1>

      <p>
            Rare disease nonprofit organizations can identify promising drugs for repurposing by researching drugs that
            have been developed for similar diseases. They also collaborate with other organizations and researchers in
            order to share information and pool resources for drug development. Even though rare diseases can be complex
            and vary greatly even between patients and subtypes of the same rare disease, there are various ways to find
            opportunities for collaboration and similarities which may be helpful in identifying promising treatments.
            If the similarities between the different rare diseases are not yet known, they can be identified through
            genomic analysis (studying the genetic makeup of patients with different rare diseases to identify common
            genetic mutations or variations that may indicate an overlap), phenotypic analysis (studying the observable
            characteristics or symptoms of patients with different rare diseases to identify commonalities) and various
            computational approaches, in which large-scale data sets of genetic, protein, cellular, etc. are analyzed to
            find potential similarities. Once a similar rare disease is identified, a rare disease nonprofit
            organization can then pursue a few avenues to learn from their treatment experience:

    Utilizing AI and machine learning (ML) to identify potential repurposed treatments is a relatively new approach, coming from information and computer science and “big data” computational analysis. It can be done in a variety of ways, which are constantly evolving and improving with the improvement in models, computational abilities. A few of these are:

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Off-label use approach</h1>

  <p>
    <b> Off-label drug use</b> refers to the use of a drug for a disease that has not been specifically approved by
    regulatory authorities, such as the FDA in the US. It is quite common (citation) and is used in cases where a drug
    has been found to be safe and effective for a new disease through research, or a physician has reason to believe it
    may help a patient from their own medical knowledge or anecdotal reports from other doctors. Additionally, doctors
    may prescribe drugs off-label for the disease which the drug is approved for, but for a different population, such
    as children, pregnant women, or other populations, which were not included in the original clinical trials. This can
    be incredibly helpful for patients that are not responding to the standard of care or have no standard of care for
    their disease. However, off-label use of drugs can also have risks. Since the safety and effectiveness of a drug for
    an off-label use have not been established, there is a potential for adverse events or lack of efficacy.

  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Tracking off-label drug use</b> can provide information on how well the drug works in different populations or
    for different conditions, as preliminary data to more formal research, or in lieu of formal research. Systematic
    tracking of off-label drug use can support its continued use and improve understanding of its effectiveness, as well
    as support the official integration into treatment guidelines.

  </p>

  <p>
    To be able to utilize off-label drug use as an avenue for drug identification, rare disease nonprofits can track
    off-label drug use in their patient populations by implementing a few different strategies:

They are used to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, and to test their toxicity, side effects, and efficacy in a living organism.

<p>
      Small animals such as mice, rats, and zebrafish are commonly used in in vivo research. These animals are relatively inexpensive, easy to handle, and have a short lifespan, which allows for the rapid completion of studies. Additionally, many of these animals have genetic similarities to humans, which makes them suitable models for human diseases. It's also possible to use transgenic animals which are genetically modified to carry a disease-causing mutation, these animals are used to study the pathology of the disease and test the drug efficacy.

</p>

<p>
      However, it's important to note that in vivo studies have ethical considerations and are subject to strict regulations. Additionally, results obtained from animal studies may not always be directly translatable to humans, so even drugs which seem promising in animal models may not end up being successful in being repurposed.

  <p><b>In vitro studies</b> are research studies that are conducted in a laboratory dish or in a test tube, as opposed to in live animals or human subjects. These studies are used to investigate the effects of drugs, chemicals, or other interventions in a controlled environment, using isolated cells or tissues.
  </p>

  <p>
    In vitro studies are an important tool for understanding the basic mechanisms of disease and the effects of drugs on the activity of enzymes or proteins, or to test the toxicity of chemicals on cells, or the genetic or environmental factors on cells or tissues, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of disease.

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Evaluation of RWE</h1>

  <p><b>Real World Evidence (RWE)</b> refers to data collected in routine clinical practice, outside of the controlled environment of a clinical trial. This type of evidence can provide valuable information on the safety and effectiveness of a drug in a real-world setting, in a broader patient population and with longer follow-up. 
  </p>
<div class = "row">
  <div class = "col-lg-4 p-4">
    <img src = "/assets/svg/icons8/marginalia-browser-window-with-graphs-in-diagrams.png" class = "img-fluid"/>
  </div>
  <div class = "col-lg-8 mt-2">

  
  <p>
    RWE can come from various sources, such as electronic health records (EHRs), claims data, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). EHRs contain detailed information on patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes, and can provide a wealth of information on a drug's safety and effectiveness in real-world settings. Claims data, which is collected by insurance providers, can also provide valuable information on a drug's utilization and effectiveness. PROs can provide insights into patients' experiences and outcomes and can be used to gather information on a drug's impact on quality of life.

  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    However, in the case of repurposed drugs, there may be limited RWE available, which can make it difficult to determine its effectiveness in the patient population of interest. This can be particularly challenging for rare diseases, as the patient population is small and the disease may have a different manifestation in different patients.

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Clinical trial</h1>

  <p>
    Clinical trials are research studies that are conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of new drugs, medical devices, or other interventions in humans, after preclinical work has been done in cell lines and/or animal models to prove basic efficacy and some basic safety. The clinical trial process is divided into several phases, each of which has a specific purpose and set of objectives.

  </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Phase I clinical trials: These are the first studies in humans. They are usually small, short-term studies that involve a small number of healthy volunteers or patients. The main objectives of Phase I trials are to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes and excretes the drug) of the new intervention.
  </li>
  <li>
    Phase II clinical trials: These studies involve a larger number of patients and are designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new intervention. The main objectives of Phase II trials are to determine the optimal dosage and to assess the effectiveness of the new drug or device.
  </li>
  <li>
    Phase III clinical trials: These studies are large, multicenter studies that involve hundreds or thousands of patients. They are designed to provide more robust data on the safety and efficacy of the new intervention, and to compare it to the current standard of care. The main objectives of Phase III trials are to confirm the effectiveness of the new drug or device and to further evaluate its safety profile.
  </li>

</ol>

<p>
  Though some drug repurposing projects go through all 3 phases, most are able to skip <b>Phase I</b> since basic safety for the drug has already been established in prior research (though if the patient population is very different from the original, sometimes it’s a good idea to start with Phase I trials even for a repurposed drug). In many/some cases, phases II and III can be combined to answer the research questions faster and with less patients. 

</p>

<p>
  After clinical trial completion, there is a submission process for FDA approval. The FDA reviews the data from the clinical trials and decides whether to approve the drug or device for use in the general population. 

</p>

<p>
  Post-approval, <b>Phase IV</b> studies are done after the FDA approves the drug and these studies are called post-marketing studies, which are done to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the drug in the general population. It's important to note that the success rate of drugs in the clinical trials is very low, especially in the later stages of trials. Also, the time and cost of clinical trials are significant, and the process of submitting the application to FDA is very difficult without the support of the pharmaceutical company who owns the drug patent. Even with support, it takes months if not years for the company to put together the documentation packet, which is often several hundred pages long.

</p>

<p>
  As discussed in other sections, there is much complexity in the design, funding, recruitment and management of clinical trials. Here we would like to point out a few clinical trial designs which might be especially useful for repurposing work:

</p>

<h4>Basket trials</h4>
<p>
  are a type of clinical trial that are used to test the effectiveness of a drug in treating multiple different diseases or subtypes of a disease. In a basket trial, a drug is tested in a group of patients with different diseases or subtypes of a disease, who all have a specific genetic mutation or biomarker in common. This allows researchers to test the effectiveness of the drug in treating multiple different diseases or subtypes of a disease at the same time, potentially saving time and money and benefiting multiple patient populations simultaneously. This approach can be particularly useful for rare diseases, where the patient population is small and the disease may have different manifestations in different patients.

</p>
<h4>Umbrella trials</h4>
<p>
  are a type of trial that test a drug in a group of patients with different diseases or subtypes of a disease based on a common theme such as a similar pathology or biology (rather than a specific genetic mutation or biomarker like in a basket trial). This allows researchers to test the effectiveness of the drug in a variety of different diseases or subtypes of a disease that share a similar pathology or biology, also potentially saving time and money and benefiting multiple patient populations simultaneously.

</p>

<h4>N-of-1 trials</h4>
<p>
  also known as "single patient trials" are a type of clinical trial that are used to test the effectiveness of a drug in a single patient, rather than in a group of patients. These trials are designed to test a drug's effectiveness in a specific individual and can provide personalized treatment options for that person, as well as provide vital insights into the disease and treatment effectiveness, which then serves as the justification for designing and conducting larger and more expensive trials. This is an especially important option for ultra-rare diseases in which large-scale clinical trials are simply impossible or for rare disease organizations which cannot financially support clinical trials.

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Off label use</h1>

  <p> 
    <b>Off-label drug use</b> refers to the use of a drug for a disease that has not been specifically approved by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA in the US. It is quite common (citation) and is used in cases where a drug has been found to be safe and effective for a new disease through research, or a physician has reason to believe it may help a patient from their own medical knowledge or anecdotal reports from other doctors. Additionally, doctors may prescribe drugs off-label for the disease which the drug is approved for, but for a different population, such as children, pregnant women, or other populations, which were not included in the original clinical trials. This can be incredibly helpful for patients that are not responding to the standard of care or have no standard of care for their disease. However, off-label use of drugs can also have risks. Since the safety and effectiveness of a drug for an off-label use have not been established, there is a potential for adverse events or lack of efficacy.

  </p>

  <p>
    In the context of clinical use during a drug repurposing project, off label use is an alternative to clinical trials if the latter are not feasible due to costs, patient size, lack of researcher or pharma support, etc. This is why it’s so important for a rare disease nonprofit to have infrastructure, whether informal such as a patient survey or a formalized natural history study, to be able to capture and track off label drug use. This will enable the nonprofit to not only be able to have a list of all drugs being prescribed or taken OTC for their rare disease of focus, but also track their effectiveness and side effects over time. This can be vital data to provide to researchers, and can be a stepping stone to more formal research, such as clinical trials, in the future.

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Approvals</h1>

  <p>
    <b>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</b> is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services that is responsible for ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices. It does not regulate vitamins and other supplements. The FDA is also responsible for ensuring that these products are accurately labeled and that they meet the standards set by the federal government.
</p>

<p>
  The FDA plays a critical role in the approval of drugs in the United States. The process of getting a drug approved by the FDA is a multi-step process that can take several years to complete. It begins with preclinical studies, which are conducted in the laboratory and in animal models. If the results of these studies are promising, the drug can then be tested in clinical trials, which are conducted in human volunteers. Once the preclinical studies are completed and the drug is validated in clinical studies, the drug sponsor (usually a pharmaceutical company) submits an application to the FDA for approval. The FDA then reviews the data from the preclinical and clinical studies, as well as other information about the drug, such as its chemical composition and how it is manufactured. If the FDA determines that the drug is safe and effective, it can approve the drug for marketing in the United States. The FDA also plays a role in monitoring the safety of drugs once they are on the market. The agency can issue safety warnings, require post-marketing studies, or even withdraw a drug from the market if it is found to be unsafe.

</p>

<p>
  For <b>drug repurposing</b>, the FDA must review and approve the new use of the drug. This process typically involves a new drug application (NDA) or a supplemental NDA (sNDA) which must be submitted by the sponsor (usually a pharmaceutical company). The FDA will review the data from preclinical and clinical studies, as well as other information about the drug, such as its chemical composition and how it is manufactured.

</p>

<p>The FDA has special provisions in place to expedite the development and approval of drugs for rare diseases, also known as orphan diseases, which are defined as diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. These provisions are intended to encourage the development of treatments for these diseases, which may not be as profitable as treatments for more common diseases.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Orphan Drug Designation: The Orphan Drug Designation program provides incentives for companies to develop drugs for rare diseases. These incentives include tax credits for clinical trial expenses, a waiver of the FDA application fee, and an exclusive marketing period for the drug once it is approved. Source
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Accelerated Approval: The FDA can grant accelerated approval to drugs for rare diseases based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a marker that is believed to predict clinical benefit, but has not been confirmed by clinical trials. Source
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Expanded Access: The FDA also has a program in place to provide access to experimental drugs to patients with rare diseases who have no other treatment options. This program is known as expanded access, or "compassionate use." Source.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Priority Review: The FDA can also grant priority review to new drug applications for rare diseases. This means that the FDA will expedite the review process for these applications and aim to take action within 6 months (instead of 10 months) of receipt. Source
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Citizen’s petition: A citizen's petition is a formal request submitted to the FDA by an individual or organization, asking the agency to take a specific action related to the regulation of a drug or device. Anyone can submit a citizen's petition, including patients, patient advocacy groups, physicians, and industry groups. The FDA is required by law to respond to citizen's petitions within 150 days. In its response, the FDA can agree with the request, deny the request, or take other actions such as requesting additional information or conducting further studies. Citizen's petitions can be used to request a wide range of actions from the FDA, such as requesting that the FDA approve a new drug, withdraw an existing drug from the market, or change the labeling of a drug. Citizen's petitions can also be used to request the FDA to take action on drug repurposing. For example, a patient advocacy group may submit a citizen's petition asking the FDA to approve a drug for a new indication, or a pharmaceutical company may submit a citizen's petition asking the FDA to change the labeling of a drug to include a new indication. Source
    </p>
  </li>

</ol>

<p>
  It's important to note that the FDA's approval process for drugs for rare diseases can be complex, and the agency may require additional data and information before approving a drug. Also, historically drug repurposing projects that do not have support of the pharmaceutical company who owns the drug patent or was the original patent holder have not been successful in being able to support FDA approval submissions due to the costs and documentation requirements necessary. Additionally, FDA's role is to ensure the safety and efficacy of the drugs, which means that even if a drug is approved for a rare disease, it may not be covered by insurance or accessible to all patients.

</p>

<p>In our ROADMAP survey data, only 6 drugs (out of our 94 total or 76 unique) drugs, have made it to FDA approval: 
</p>

<p>
  Dupilumab // Campaign Urging Research for Eosinophilic Disease // Eosinophilic diseases
Selumetinib // Children's Tumor Foundation // Neurofibromatosis
Alpelisib // CLOVES Syndrome Community // CLOVES syndrome
Rituximab // International Pemphigus Pemphigoid Foundation // Pemphigus, Pemphigoid
Sirolimus // LAM Foundation // Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
Pazopanib // Cure HHT (NOTE - “Received FDA Breakthrough designation,” not FDA approval) // Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
</p>

<p>
  Looking closer at these 6 organizations, which have had a drug make it to FDA approval through drug repurposing, they are on average <b>26.7</b> years old (range: <b>11-44</b>); their annual funding ranged from <b>$100,000</b> to <b>more than $5,000,000</b> (the most common selection was <b>between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000</b>); and they have the following characteristics: <b>all 6</b> have an SAB/MAB, <b>1</b> has a biobank, <b>4</b> have a natural history study, <b>2</b>  have a patient registry, and <b>3</b> already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing. A testament to the dedication of their volunteers in the pursuit of success, one of these organizations has no full time staff, relying entirely on volunteer or part-time staff to achieve their success, while the other five have anywhere from <b>1</b> to <b>40</b> full time staff.

  <h2>Subjectively-reported success
    
  </h2>

<p>
  One way to conceptualize success in drug repurposing is through a subjective assessment of whether the drug has helped achieve a significant effect on something that is important to patients, outside of official FDA approval, such as:

</p>

<p>
  Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms
Significant improvement in quality of life 
Increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality
Provide cure of disease
Provide prevention of relapse

</p>

<p>
  Because it is difficult to qualify what is a “significant” reduction or improvement without formal data with a clinical trial, these measures are open to various biases and inaccuracies due to this subjective nature. Nevertheless, we felt that it was important to calculate how many organizations in our data felt that they have reached one or more of these endpoints. Not only to be able to capture a wider variety of success definitions for the sake of the projects themselves, but also to engage with a more patient-centric definition of success, as there are things that are important to patients, which may not be prioritized from a research perspective or measured as a part of a clinical trial. 

</p>

<p>For more details on this, check out Organizational support options ➡️Research support ➡️Leading the creation of patient-centered research agenda</p>

<p>
  If we utilize the criteria of counting an organization as “successful” if they have met at least one subjectively-reported success endpoint for at least one drug, and counting all other organizations as “not yet successful”, we end up with <b>13</b> successful and <b>45</b> not yet successful organizations. Looking closer at the <b>13</b> successful organizations, they are on average <b>18.31</b> years old (range: <b>2-44</b>); the majority (<b>4 organizations</b>, 30.77%) reported an annual funding <b>between $100,000 and $500,00</b>; and they have the following characteristics: <b>12</b> (92.31%) have an SAB, <b>5</b> (38.46%) have a biobank, <b>8</b> (61.54%) have a natural history study, <b>8</b> (61.54%) have a formal research agenda, <b>7</b> (53.85%) have a patient registry, and <b>5</b> (38.46) already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing (one organization has two FDA-approved drugs).  <b>6</b> (46.15%) have no full time  staff, relying entirely on volunteer and/or part-time  labor to achieve their success.

</p>

<p>
  Among these <b>13</b> subjectively “successful” organizations, there are <b>45</b> unique drugs being repurposed. The most common drugs among these organizations were <b>Sirolimus</b> (<b>4 organizations</b>) and <b>Trametinib/Everolimus/Dupilumab/Bevacizumab</b> (<b>2 organizations each</b>). The most common identification method for these drugs was <b>Preclinical/Translational research (31)</b>, closely followed by <b>data from similar diseases (20)</b> and <b>off-label use (17)</b>. Most of these drugs are currently in early stages, specifically the <b>recruiting patients for clinical trials (18)</b> stage. Their respective rare diseases have the following characteristics: <b>8</b> (61.54%) have treatment guidelines, <b>9</b> (69.23%) have an identified genetic mutation, <b>9</b> (69.23%) have an ICD code, <b>13</b> (100%) have animal models, <b>1</b> (76.92%) have cell lines developed, <b>4</b> (30.77%) have predictive biomarkers and <b>6</b> (46.15%) have a clear understanding of etiology or disease pathogenesis.

  <h1 class = "mb-5">Abandoned</h1>

  <p>
    Though this is listed at the end of the ROADMAP, a drug repurposing project may be abandoned at any stage of the process. Some of the common reasons include:

  </p>

<h4>
  Lack of efficacy
</h4>
<p>
  If preclinical or clinical studies do not show that the drug is effective in treating the new indication, the project may be abandoned.

</p>

<h4>Safety concerns

</h4>

<p>
  If the drug is found to have significant side effects or safety concerns, the project may be abandoned.

</p>

<h4>
  Lack of funding
</h4>
<p>
  Drug repurposing projects can be expensive, and if funding is not available to continue the project, it may be abandoned.

</p>

<h4>
  Lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies
</h4>
<p>
  Pharmaceutical companies are often the sponsors of drug repurposing projects, and if a company is not interested in pursuing a particular project, it may be abandoned.

</p>
<h4>Difficulty in recruiting patients</h4>
<p>If it is difficult to recruit patients for clinical trials, the project may be abandoned.
</p>

<h4>Regulatory hurdles</h4>
<p>The process of getting a drug approved for a new indication can be complex and time-consuming, and if the project encounters significant regulatory hurdles, it may be abandoned.
</p>

<h4>
  Competitive landscape
</h4>

<p>
  If there are already other drugs available that are effective in treating the same indication, the project may be abandoned.

</p>

<h4>
  Lack of commercial viability
</h4>

<p>
  If the repurposed drug is not seen as commercially viable, it may not be pursued by the pharmaceutical companies.

</p>

<p>
  And though “abandoned” as a status has a negative connotation, it is very important to be able to filter out which drugs are most promising and which are not, and overall, having some drugs be abandoned can speed up the process of getting one that can bring the most value to the patient population.
