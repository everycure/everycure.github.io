                <h1>Supporting repurposing</h4>

                    
                    <p>
                        Among the stakeholders involved in the drug repurposing process, rare disease nonprofit organizations are a powerful intermediary between the patients, researchers, physicians, regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other actors. Their power lies in leveraging their personal passion and perseverance against all odds to help patients and create and foster the right ecosystem to drive forward drug repurposing efforts for their rare disease(s). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ways that a rare disease organization can support drug repurposing projects fall into four somewhat overlapping categories:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Funding support</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Research support</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Partnering & collaboration</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Patient support</b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
    
      </div>
