    <h1>Drug repurposing</h1>
    <p>
        In this section, discover how rare disease organizations pursue drug repurposing through insights gathered from the ROADMAP survey. Here we cover the level of interest, drug identification methods, challenges, and future plans of organizations supporting repurposing initiatives for various rare diseases.

In our data, 58 organizations reported that this was the case in their rare disease space.

            <p>
                Among the reasons for why the inexperienced organizations have not yet pursued drug repurposing projects, the top three in our data were a lack of funds, a lack of information for how to best pursue drug repurposing and a lack of staff to help support this project. Notably, 5 organizations stated that they have never heard of drug repurposing before.

                Traditional preclinical/translational research approaches led to the identification of 65 drug(s) for repurposing, while 28 drugs were identified by looking at similar diseases/conditions. High throughput drug screens, though often thought of as the most common repurposing method, was only utilized to identify 21 drugs in our dataset.

Lack of pharmaceutical company support was slowing down the repurposing process for 24 drugs, and small patient populations were causing issues for 17 drugs. Interestingly, 14 drug projects are reported to be going forward without hitting any roadblocks.

                We asked participating organizations to select where they feel they need additional support based on three main categories: more collaboration, more data/information, and more resources. For collaboration, the top choices were to connect with organizations focused on the same or similar rare disease(s), partnering for the development of clinical trials, and developing outcome measures. For those that selected that they needed more data/information, the top choices were also in developing robust outcome measures, as well as developing a drug target and understanding the natural history of the disease. As for more resources, they are needed most in developing research infrastructure and models, developing clinical trials and improving patient access to off-label drugs.
