    <h1>Physicians</h1>
    <p>
        As a part of the ROADMAP project participation, we asked the rare disease nonprofits to forward the survey to their US-based physician network and invite them to take the survey. Our focus in the physician section of the survey was on off-label drug prescription practices, the factors that physicians consider when deciding to prescribe a drug off-label, as well as their involvement in clinical trials for rare diseases. Although the sample size of participating physicians was small (21), we present the data as an initial reference for understanding physician involvement in different aspects of drug repurposing initiatives. Making broad generalizations as to physicians that treat rare disease based on this data may be challenging based on the small sample size.

                        Off-label drug use for rare diseases can offer a viable treatment option for patients when approved therapies are not available. The fact that a significant proportion of physicians in the dataset (70.6%) are aware of off-label drug options for the rare diseases they treat is encouraging and highlights the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest research and treatment options. However, it is important to note that off-label drug use should be closely monitored and that additional research is needed to better understand the potential benefits and risks of using these drugs in the context of rare diseases.

The statement emphasizes the importance of providing more choices for patients with rare diseases and monitoring the usage of off-label medications over time. This can help identify which patients could potentially benefit from a specific drug, along with information about appropriate dosage and treatment to maximize benefit.

                        Sharing a patient's clinical response to off-label drug use with other physicians can be incredibly valuable for several reasons. It allows for collaboration and the exchange of ideas among medical professionals, which can ultimately lead to better patient outcomes.

                    <p>
                        In our data, 53% of physicians reported to regularly engage in sharing information about their patientâ€™s clinical response to treatment with off-label drugs.

            <p>
                For purposes of this project, we utilized a broad definition of drug repurposing, as a process of research to identify potential treatments that are already FDA-approved or in development for one disease, for use in another disease by gathering data and analyzing efficacy in order to improve treatment guidelines and access.

            <p>
                More than half of physicians in our data reported being somewhat or highly familiar with drug repurposing (12, 70.6%). This is promising, as it suggests that physicians are aware of ongoing research for alternative treatment options beyond their approved uses, which could potentially lead to the development of new treatments for rare diseases and other conditions.
