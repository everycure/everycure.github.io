<h2>
    Repurposing drugs for rare diseases
</h2>
<p>
    There are approximately 10,000 rare diseases affecting approximately 30,000,000 individuals in the U.S.A (1,2). Despite significant investments in resources over the last several decades, more than 90% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA-approved therapy (3). This fact highlights the failure of traditional new drug development to overcome the unique challenges faced by rare disease research and the need for alternative approaches. 
</p>

<p>
    Given that many diseases share the same underlying problems, the same treatments can often be used to treat multiple diseases. While this process is faster and less expensive than new drug development and repurposed treatments are sometimes found serendipitously, a number of barriers prevent this from happening systematically. Thus, repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs to treat rare diseases is a promising approach to help patients as quickly as possible. Similarly, drugs developed for one condition but proven ineffective or unsafe and thus never approved for the intended condition can also be used in another disease. Because the basic research and preliminary safety studies on the compound have already been completed, drug repurposing and repositioning is able to skip many steps and costs. Additionally, because the repurposed drug has already been proven safe and effective in another disease, it has a higher likelihood to succeed in clinical trials, compared to new, untested compounds (4). 
</p>

<p>
    For purposes of this project, the definition of drug repurposing is: "A process of research to identify potential treatments that are already FDA-approved or in development for one disease, for use in another disease by gathering data and analyzing efficacy in order to improve treatment guidelines and access". This includes the following:
</p>


<ul class = "liststylenone">
    <li>
        <b>Repurposing</b>: an FDA-approved drug used for another disease from the one that it is approved for.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Repositioning</b>: a drug with some safety and/or efficacy data in one disease and modifying its structure for use in another disease.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Reformulation</b>: a drug with some safety and/or efficacy data in one disease and modifying its method of administration or dose for use in another disease.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Rescue</b>: a drug that’s not FDA-approved for any diseases due to complications in either safety and/or efficacy in the intended disease and used for another disease while maintaining the same structure and method of administration.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Due to the complexity of the steps involved for each type, the ROADMAP tool was created with a focus on repurposing drugs that are on the market, however, we refer to steps relevant to repositioning, reformulation or rescue throughout the tool.  
</p>

<p>
    There are a number of notable examples of drugs that have been repurposed to save rare disease patient lives, such as sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension (originally for erectile dysfunction) (5), thalidomide for multiple myeloma (originally for leprosy) (6), and sirolimus for Castleman disease (originally for transplant rejection) (7).
</p>

<p>
    Given the above, there is tremendous enthusiasm and interest in how to repurpose existing drugs for rare diseases, particularly from rare disease nonprofit organizations. However, the process and steps for how to effectively repurpose treatments is not clear.  Through a partnership between the <a href = "https://cdcn.org/" target = "_blank">Castleman Disease Collaborative Network</a> (CDCN), <a href = "https://chanzuckerberg.com/" target = "_blank">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a> (CZI), and <a href = "https://everycure.org/" target = "_blank">Every Cure</a>, we launched the Repurposing Of All Drugs, Mapping All Paths (ROADMAP) project to identify the paths that can be taken to repurpose drugs, highlight the roles of various stakeholders, and centralize information on how to do this most effectively.

    The Repurposing Of All Drugs, Mapping All Paths (ROADMAP) project aims to identify the paths that can be taken to repurpose drugs, highlight the roles of various stakeholders, and centralize information on how to do this most effectively through an interactive “ROADMAP” tool. This project is supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI).

<p>
    In order to understand the most effective paths for rare disease drug repurposing, we needed to obtain data on the paths taken by rare disease stakeholders and the roadblocks they are facing. We began by identifying as many rare disease nonprofit organizations and potential stakeholders as possible, distributing a survey to these stakeholders, and performing in-depth interviews with a subgroup of representative stakeholders. Then, we utilized this information along with our experiences from rare disease drug repurposing to build out the ROADMAP. We have separated out this approach into the following six steps:
</p>

    <li>
        Identifying and Characterizing stakeholders

    <li>
        Survey Execution

            <h2>Identifying and characterizing stakeholders</h2>
            <h3>
    Identifying all rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US
</h3>

<p>
    First, we set out to build a comprehensive list of all rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US. From here we hoped to gain an understanding of how many of them support research and drug repurposing in particular. Unfortunately, this list did not exist. We assembled a team of volunteers to combine several existing lists of organizations (i.e. NORD members, Global Genes members) and to perform additional searches to find more organizations. The final compiled list contained 982 organizations. 
</p>

<h3>
    Characterizing rare disease nonprofit organizations
</h3>

<p>
    Next, a larger team of 70+ volunteers spent seven months (05/18/2021-12/16/2021) extracting data from the websites of these organizations, looking for:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Whether the organization satisfied our inclusion criteria: US-based, registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, focused on one or more rare diseases (one that affects less than 200,000 people in the US (2) and having an active website
    </li>
    <li>
        Basic organizational info: year of founding, name & contact information of founders
    </li>
    <li>
        Information on the organization’s programs: conference, research agenda, biobank, registry, natural history study, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whether the rare disease has treatment guidelines, or whether it is known that it is caused by a genetic mutation
    </li>
    <li>
        Any mention of drug repurposing, and if so - which drug(s) were pursued
    </li>
    <li>
        Any mention of partnerships or collaborations with other organizations 
    </li>
</ul>

As a result of this exercise, <b>711</b> organizations were confirmed as rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US with active websites as of 12/2021. This dataset has been made available open-source <a href = "/resources.html" target = "_blank">here</a>. 

<h3>
    UpToDate Data on Off-label use
</h3>

<p>
    We also onboarded a team of 10 extractors who had some medical expertise or medical educational background. We took a subset of 100 rare diseases from our ROADMAP survey data and conducted an extraction process of identifying how many rare diseases had off-label drugs as a part of the official treatment guidelines on UpToDate.com, a well-known and trusted electronic clinical resource tool for physicians. From <b>2/17/2022</b> to <b>7/14/2022</b>, the team extracted every drug mentioned on the UpToDate page regarding a specific rare disease in the list and coded the drug entry on its “context” and “status”:
</p>

<ul class = "liststylenone">
    <li>
        <b>Context</b> refers to how the drug was mentioned on the UpToDate page. The options were “Context: Drug is recommended or listed as potentially helpful” and “Drug listed as does not work for this disease AND/OR no longer given AND/OR not recommended”. </li>
    <li>
        <b>Status</b> refers to the drugs’ approval status. The options were “FDA approved for another disease”, “FDA approved for this rare disease” and “Not FDA approved for anything”. 
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The goal of this data extraction was to understand the current state of rare disease treatment. A commonly used statistic is that 95% of rare diseases do not have an FDA-approved treatment. As far as we know, this statistic is never cited in any original research or dataset, so it is not clear how accurate it is. Furthermore, it does not tell us how many of these rare diseases have off-label (FDA approved for another disease, but not FDA approved for that rare disease) treatments available for them. This is crucial information for us to understand the state of rare disease treatment in the US and the need for drug repurposing.

            <h2> Survey execution</h2>
            <h3>
    Survey design
</h3>

<p>
    We designed a comprehensive survey using the Qualtrics platform, which included sections for several different stakeholder types: 
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Rare disease nonprofit organization leaders
    </li>
    <li>
        Rare disease patients
    </li>
    <li>
        Rare disease patients’ loved one (parent, spouse, friend, sibling, etc. of a rare disease patient)
    </li>
    <li>
        Physicians who treat rare diseases 
    </li>
    <li>
        Rare disease researchers
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Any member of the leadership team of a US-based rare disease-focused nonprofit organization was able to participate in this research project. They were then invited to directly reach out to their US-based patient, loved one, physician, and researcher network and invite them to take the survey. Since rare diseases predominantly affect children, we allowed participants under 18 to participate in the project through an adult loved one who provided informed consent and took the survey. Additionally, since many rare diseases cause physical and cognitive disabilities, we allowed those patients to also participate in the survey through a loved one, regardless of the patient’s age. Also, we included an option for patients and loved ones to participate in Spanish, in order to be as inclusive as possible. 

</p>

<p>
    We focused our questions on potentially unique insights from each stakeholder: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Rare disease nonprofit organization leaders</b>: organizational characteristics (<i>age, funding, staff size, etc.</i>), level of resources (<i>biobank, patient registry, natural history study, scientific advisory board, etc.</i>), the rare disease state of research (<i>availability of treatment guidelines, diagnostic criteria, ICD code, biomarkers, etc.</i>), information on any FDA or off-label drugs being utilized, and drug repurposing experience, including challenges they’ve encountered, the support they need, and who was in their collaboration network. 

    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Rare disease patients and their loved ones</b> (both stakeholders received the same set of questions): experience with off-label drugs for their rare disease and their general attitude towards and comfort level with drug repurposing. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Physicians</b>: the frequency of and ​factors that are taken into consideration when deciding to prescribe a drug off-label, off-label drug prescription practices for the rare diseases they treat, and levels of involvement in clinical trials for rare diseases. 

    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Researchers</b>: involvement in research projects to advance drug repurposing for any rare diseases, what their motivations are, and what challenges they’ve encountered. 

    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Preliminary Interviews
</h3>
<p>
    We conducted 10 preliminary semi-structured interviews with a selection of rare disease nonprofits, in order to receive feedback to refine the survey and project communication materials.
</p>

<h3>
    Survey Dissemination
</h3>

<p>
    We distributed the survey to all US-based rare disease organizations identified previously. Since this project is supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the survey was also disseminated by the CZI leadership team to the organizations as a part of their <a href = "https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/rare-as-one/" target = "_blank">Rare As One initiative</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The survey was officially launched on 9/29/2021 and stayed open for data collection until 1/6/2022. Because the survey included several sections and many of the respondents represented multiple stakeholders and were able to opt into multiple sections at once, we opted to include incomplete surveys at the end of the data collection period in order to gather the most data possible. In total, we received <b>1,923</b> total survey responses (completes and incompletes), which, after data cleaning and deduplication, included <b>723</b> total respondents (605 unique): <b>147</b> organization representatives, <b>340</b> patients, <b>170</b> loved ones, <b>23</b> physicians, and <b>43</b> researchers. Based on our search for rare disease nonprofit organizations, there are <b>711</b> active rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US. This means that we gathered data from approximately <b>20.7%</b> of the total sample , which is notable. Though there is an obvious selection bias to organizations who are interested or pursuing drug repurposing to take our survey, review of the characteristics of these organizations suggests that we captured a variety of organizations.
</p>

<h3>
    Targeted Follow-up Survey
</h3>
<p>
    Of note, an error in the Qualtrics platform was identified in which a significant section of the patient/loved one survey was not shown to any participants. To address this, a follow up survey with these questions was sent to the 344 participants who consented to follow up. Among the <b>200</b> that responded, we were able to successfully match <b>191</b> to their original responses (See Merging Procedure below) and <b>156</b> met all inclusion criteria to be included in the full dataset for analysis.

          <section id="survey-data-analysis">
            <h2>Survey data analysis</h2>
            <p>
    The ROADMAP team did extensive data cleaning and analysis of the survey data, primarily using R studio (8), packages: tidyverse (9), stringr (10), dplyr (11), and googlesheets4 (12).
</p>

<h3>
    Inclusion criteria implementation & data cleaning
</h3>

<p>
    The data cleaning process consisted of five steps, which were executed concurrently:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Implementing inclusion criteria
    </li>
    <li>
        Deduplication and merging
    </li>
    <li>
        Name cleaning and translations 
    </li>
    <li>
        (Re-)classification and categorization 
    </li>
    <li>
        Data changes, corrections, and updates 
    </li>
</ol>


<h4>
    1. Implementing inclusion criteria

</h4>

<p>
    Organizations were removed from the final dataset for the following reasons*:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Organization was not a registered 501c3 nonprofit
    </li>
    <li>
        Organization does not support a rare disease
    </li>
    <li>
        Organization did not meet US location criteria (<b>155</b>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Data submitted to Qualtrics after completion deadline (<b>6</b>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Progress less than 10% survey completion (<b>399</b>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Did not consent / did not answer consent question (<b>572</b>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Did not answer any questions associated with stakeholder sections (<b>53</b>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Data was a duplicate marked for removal (see “Deduplication and merging” for details) (<b>10</b>, not including RDNPs)
    </li>
</ul>

<p><i>
    <small>*We applied each inclusion/exclusion criteria in the order presented here and updated the numbers of removals that were made after each step was applied to the dataset. This means that survey entries from later steps (e.g., “Didn’t meet US location criteria”) do not include entries from earlier steps (e.g., progress less than 10%). 
    </i></p></small>
<p>
    In total, <b>1,324</b> entries (out of an original <b>1,929</b>) were removed due to not meeting inclusion criteria leaving <b>605</b> entries that qualified to remain in the final dataset.
</p>



<h4>
    2. Deduplication and merging
</h4>

<b>Deduplication procedure</b>

<p>
    In some cases, the same individual completed the survey twice. To identify these cases, we looked for duplicate email addresses and/or IP addresses, as there was no other identifiable data collected via the survey. Then, we identified mismatches between their survey responses, if any, and manually reconciled these differences by combining information to make entries as complete as possible. We also resolved any contradictions and inconsistencies between entries that we identified. 
</p>

<p>
    There were some cases where multiple rare disease nonprofit representatives completed the survey for the same organization, causing this deduplication process to be more complex. To identify these cases, we looked for rare disease nonprofit name matches among those who opted into the associated section of the survey. Then, we compared the completion rates on these entries; entries with higher progress were automatically selected over entries with lower progress. In cases where the completion rate of each entry was equal (e.g., 100%), we compared the titles of each representative. In cases where one entry’s representative had seniority (founder, CEO, executive director), we kept that entry. In a select handful of cases where both the progress and participant hierarchical standing were equal, we followed the same process described prior and manually reconciled any differences identified.

  <b>Merging procedure</b>

  <p>
    The merging procedure involved combining the data from the follow up survey with the original survey data as described in a prior section. We began with <b>200</b> follow-up survey entries, and we successfully matched <b>191</b> of these entries to their corresponding ROADMAP survey entries. To do so, we compared the IP and email addresses from the original and follow-up surveys, and we merged entries where matches were found. We then isolated the data on which drugs patients from each survey reported taking. We compared groupings of drugs, and combined entries where unique matching pairs were found. Ultimately, we discarded 9 follow-up survey entries that could not be matched to the original survey data via IP/email addresses or drug names.
  </p>

  <p>
    It should be noted that while <b>191</b> successful matches were made, only <b>156</b> entries were ultimately combined with their original ROADMAP survey data. This is because <b>35</b> of the follow-up survey entries were from respondents whose entries were removed from the dataset during the inclusion filtering process outlined in the <i>“Filtering based on inclusion criteria”</i> and <i>“Deduplication and merging”</i> sections. 
  </p>


  <h4>
    3. Name cleaning and translations
</h4>

<b>
    Name cleaning
</b>

<p>
    We reviewed and cleaned all manually-inputted job titles, specialties, organization names, disease names, and drug names. While each process varied in its scale (whereas there were only a few unique specialties to clean, there were hundreds of drug names to clean) and scope (e.g., drug/disease name cleaning efforts were extended to additional projects), the actual cleaning process was nearly identical across each cleaning activity. 
</p>

<p>
    Each step in the cleaning process required isolating unique names, and then developing a “key-pair” dictionary with a column for the original name, and a column for its (optional) replacement.  Members of the ROADMAP team, including volunteers, would then review the original names, identify inaccuracies and inconsistencies, and generate a final list of accurate replacements. In some cases, data was marked for removal (e.g., if a disease listed was not rare, or a drug listed as FDA-approved turned out to not be FDA-approved). Any use of brand-name drugs was replaced with their generic name, and the names of pharmaceutical salts were removed as well. Acronyms were avoided whenever possible. Each dictionary was imported into R and used to clean the corresponding survey data.

<b>Translations</b>

<p>
    Two participants who met our inclusion criteria completed the Spanish-language version of the survey. To ensure that their data would be represented in our analysis, we translated their survey responses into English. In cases where translations of participant-entered text were required, two Spanish speakers (one native speaker, and one non-native speaker) reviewed each translation for accuracy.
</p>

<h4>
    4. (Re-)classification and categorization
</h4>

<p>
    For the purposes of analysis and visualization, we created new variables that were used to classify/categorize existing data. Examples include, but are not limited to the following:
</p>

<ul class = "liststylenone">
    <li>
        Creating new categories for existing questions based on responses provided in the “other” sections
    </li>
    <li>
        Classifying disease names
    </li>
    <li>
        Classifying drug repurposing stages, status, and progress
    </li>
    <li>
        Classifying job titles
    </li>
    <li>
        Creating new variables (e.g., indicating whether drugs are FDA-approved based on human review; indicating whether an organization is focused on multiple diseases)
    </li>
</ul>

  <p>
    Additionally, some response categories were renamed, merged, and/or removed based on team expertise and consensus.
  </p>
  

<h4>
    5. Data changes, corrections, and updates
</h4>

<p>
    We have made changes, corrections, and updates to our data on an ongoing, case-by-case basis. While we made minor updates to our patient, loved one, researcher, and physician data, most of our updates have been made to our rare disease nonprofit survey data. For example, in the rare case when a drug status change was identified among our list of 147 rare disease nonprofits since (e.g., a new drug being targeted for repurposing; a drug receiving FDA approval), we updated all survey question data corresponding to that drug. In a few instances where participant clarification was required to resolve inconsistencies, we reached out directly to rare disease nonprofits for their assistance using the email addresses that they provided. In some of these cases - such as when the participants directly let us know that the drug was listed in error - we would remove all data related to that drug from our dataset. Except for these major changes, we did not make updates based on any other status updates that were discovered throughout the research and interview process, and the dataset provides a snapshot of the state of drug repurposing as of survey date completion and some of the data may be or soon will be outdated.
</p>

<h3>
    Data analysis
</h3>

<p>
    The survey data analysis process mostly focused on:
</p>


<ol>
    <li>
        Descriptive statistics
    </li>
    <li>
        Categorization
    </li>
    <li>
        Visualization
    </li>
</ol>



<h4>
    1. Descriptive statistics 
</h4>

<p>
    We performed descriptive statistics analysis to report basic quantitative statistical data about the ROADMAP survey. Examples include frequencies, measures of central tendency, and correlations. Generally speaking, we summarized raw survey data in our descriptive analysis. In a handful of cases, however, we developed new variables and/or created aggregations of variables for the purposes of analysis. All descriptive statistics have been calculated using R and R studio(8).  The overarching goal of this descriptive analysis has been to characterize the rare disease nonprofits who participated in the ROADMAP survey (their typologies; outcomes and endpoints; characteristics; resources; etc.). Below, we review the general process that we followed to visualize, report, and share our findings from the ROADMAP survey. We also explore in more detail how we used the descriptive data that we collected to answer essential questions about the drug repurposing process and the progress of RDNPs in their drug repurposing journeys.
</p>

<p>
    Most of the descriptive data that we generated were presented through bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds, among other visualizations. We created rough drafts of these visualizations using R. We generally focused on showcasing aggregated frequencies of survey options. In certain cases, multiple questions were combined and aggregated; in other cases, individual questions were broken down into multiple charts. Once we narrowed our selection of visualizations and created summaries of our findings, we built out a set of interactive web pages showcasing these final visualizations and the insights gathered from them. The ROADMAP Project’s Survey Insights, available to explore <a href = "survey-insights-welcome.html" target = "_blank">here</a>, are one of the ways that rare disease nonprofit organizations, as well as any other interested stakeholders, can explore our dataset and use it to inform further research or generate new insights.

<b>
    Drug Repurposing
</b>

<p>
    In order to analyze the progress of rare disease nonprofits in the drug repurposing process, we categorized the various steps involved in this process into stages. The stages that we developed were based on several questions from the survey:
</p>


<ul class = "liststylenone">
    <li>
        <b>Early stage</b>: Securing funding, testing existing drugs in mouse or other animal models, trying to secure researcher interest to pursue, patient data collection, recruiting patients for clinical trials)
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Clinical trials</b>: stage I, II, III clinical trials or analyzing clinical trial data 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Late stage</b>: submitting clinical trial data to FDA

    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Endpoint</b>:
    <br>
    <span class = "mx-4">FDA approval</span><br>
    <span class = "mx-4">Use off-label with some measures of subjective success</span><br>
    <span class = "mx-4">Unsuccessful (project abandoned or FDA approval denied)</span>
. 

    </li>
</ul>








<!-- 
    
    STOPPED HERE



<p>
    Once we had identified and classified these stages, we began to formulate specific questions about our data. While our general interest was to assess the relationship between organizational characteristics, drug identification methods, and stage(s) of progress, specific research questions included (but were not limited to): 

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        How many organizations had how many drugs in what stages currently?

    </li>
    <li>
        How each drug was identified and what stage is it in currently?

    </li>
    <li>
        How/Whether each organization's characteristics are related to the drug identification method used?

    </li>
    <li>
        How/Whether the drug identification method is related to the various types of “success” endpoints?

    </li>

</ul>

<p>
    To answer these questions, we developed cross-tabulations of our data. By “cross-tabulation,” we are referring to the process of taking data from an entire group, and then breaking this data into subgroups in order to look for patterns, trends, or other noteworthy observations. To be clear, this was a purely descriptive undertaking: we did not perform any kind of inferential or predictive statistics using our data. Instead, we focused on reporting raw frequencies, proportions, and percentages, and we used these numbers to help describe, characterize, and summarize our drug repurposing data, as well as answer the specific research questions outlined above. 

</p>

<p>
    One challenge that we had to address in developing cross-tabulations was that we were asking questions about two different units of analysis: in one case, drugs being repurposed (94 total); in another case, the organizations involved in drug repurposing (40 total). To address this, we made two separate sets of cross-tabulations, each taking a different unit of analysis. Both sets of cross-tabulations included the aforementioned list of drug repurposing stages (early, clinical trials, late, etc.). When taking repurposed drugs as our unit of analysis, we summarized this information on a per-drug basis. When taking organizations as our unit of analysis, we summarized this information on a per-organization basis. This required “flattening” the data of organizations repurposing multiple drugs into single yes/no responses. We therefore decided that when looking at this data on an organizational level, any “yes” responses from an organization’s survey data would overwrite any “no” responses, as our goal here was to understand whether they had reached a given stage at any point; we relied on the drug repurposing cross-tabulations for more fine-grained information about how many specific drug repurposing projects reached each stage.

</p>

<p>
    When taking organizations as our unit of analysis, we compared our stage data with our data on organizational characteristics/resources. When taking repurposed drugs as our unit of analysis, we compared our data on stages with our data on drug identification methods. In the table below, "drug repurposing stages are represented in the rows, while drug identification methods are represented in the columns.” Each stage / drug identification method is broken into a “yes” and “no” subcategory, where “yes” indicates that a survey-taker explicitly answered “yes” to the corresponding survey question(s), and vice versa for “no” selections. We filtered out cases where the question was left completely blank (instead of inferring, for example, that this indicates a “no”), meaning that our marginal totals (the sum of all cells in a given 2x2 contingency table) do not always neatly sum to 94/40. 

</p>

<p>
    Each set of 4 gray highlighted squares in the snapshot below represents a single 2x2 contingency table that we could study individually and/or compare against other 2x2 contingency tables. 

</p>

<figure class = " py-4">

    <figcaption>Snapshot of the contingency table looking at drug identification methods and where the drug is currently
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    For a concrete example of how the above contingency table is read, we can “zoom in” on the top-left 2x2 contingency table, which displays information about two subgroups of drugs being repurposed: those in the “early” stage of drug repurposing and those that relied on “medical data” in the drug identification process. Looking at the below table tells us the following information about the relationship between this specific stage and drug identification method:

<h4>
    2. Categorization

</h4>

<p>
    One of the important outcomes of the ROADMAP project was a comprehensive understanding of all the “menu” items in the drug repurposing process, namely all the steps involved and all the options that a researcher can pursue or a representative of a rare disease nonprofit can support. Based on our experience and expertise, the ROADMAP team implemented a preliminary list of options in the survey, but via user feedback from various stakeholders, we were able to build out a more detailed breakdown of both the stages involved in the drug repurposing process as well as the options that are available for selection within each step. This categorization was done through an ongoing manual, collaborative visualization exercise using the tool MIRO (citation), which allows for mind mapping, timeline building and other visualization techniques in an infinite, collaborative workspace. We also utilized this approach to merge the interview insights with the existing survey data, which we will describe in a later section.

<h4>
    3. Network Visualization

</h4>

<p>
    One of the sections of the rare disease nonprofit organization representative survey focused exclusively on their collaboration network. In this section, the rare disease nonprofit organization representatives were asked to list their top collaborator organizations by name, and then specify what kind of collaboration activities they were engaged in with them. From this data, we also built a network dataset of nodes (organization) and edges (the relationships between organizations). We visualized this network using a tool called Gephi (citation). This allowed us to gain a better understanding of the types of relationships going on between different rare disease nonprofit organizations, as well as their external links to research institutions, pharmaceutical companies and government organizations.

            <h2>Interview execution</h2>
            <p>
    From the 147 rare disease nonprofit organizations in our survey data, we developed a typology of organizations based on various internal characteristics and drug repurposing experience.

</p>


<figure class = " py-4">
    <img class = "img-fluid shadow-3-strong" src = "/assets/images/about/typology-full.png"/>
    <figcaption>Typology of organizations for interviewee selection [RDNP names hidden for data confidentiality]

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Based on the typology, we selected 32 rare disease nonprofit organizations for participation in the interview phase of the project. We selected all 15 rare disease nonprofit organizations which selected at least one subjective success endpoint to have been met, and 17 organizations where no subjective success endpoints have been met yet. Out of these 17, we selected a sample from each stage of the repurposing process, and organizations that were comparable by the other characteristics (age, funding level, staff size, etc.) We did comparisons of our selected organizations both internally (15 vs 17 organizations) as well as comparing them to the total 147, as well as those we selected for interviews vs those not selected (32 vs 115). Overall, we were satisfied with our selection, that it captured a good variability across all important characteristics.

        We then invited a member of the leadership team of all 32 organizations to participate via email, and 25 agreed to participate and were interviewed. The ROADMAP project lead conducted all 25 60-minute semi-structured interviews with them over the course of two months via ZOOM. The interview protocol focused on questions regarding their experience of drug repurposing, based on a preliminary framework consisting of four stages: 1. Preparation, 2. Drug Identification, 3. Validations, 4. Clinical Use and 5. Optimal Utilization. Within each step, we generally discussed how they executed each step, how long each step took, how the decision was made as to what approach to take, what challenges they faced, what advice they have for other organizations, who they collaborated with, and what resources they utilized. In cases when organizations were in the process of repurposing multiple drugs, the interviewees were asked to discuss the ones that were either the farthest along in the process, or with which they had the most varied experiences, so that on aggregate, the ROADMAP would contain insights from as many varied experiences as possible. Because of this, even though 25 organizations were interviewed, we were able to capture the experiences of repurposing 75 drugs.

            <h2>Interview data analysis</h2>
            <p>
    The interview audio was transcribed and cleaned utilizing Otter.ai (citation), with a final manual review from research assistants and project lead to guarantee accuracy of transcript data. Then, the project  team utilized a tool called Dedoose (citation) to conduct an iterative thematic analysis of the interview transcripts (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The project lead identified and coded statements from the interview transcript that answered a research question and generated a list of themes from these codes; this resulted in 120 themes. The project lead and research assistant then synthesized the themes into five categories of findings: 1. General Description, 2. Insights, 3. Roadblocks, and 4. Support Options and 5. Resources. We then utilized a mind mapping software MIRO, as mentioned in previous sections, to identify and categorize data visually and collaboratively. This process was crucial in making sure our interview insights helped fill in any missing categories from our survey data, and provide additional advice or nuance which we were not able to capture via survey.

    The qualitative insights from the interviews were then combined with the survey data and integrated into an interactive "ROADMAP" tool and data explorer interface. One of the most important aspects of this project is that it can help the rare disease community, and that this data will be made available.

    <b>The interactive ROADMAP tool
    </b><br>
    The ROADMAP tool was developed using <a href = "https://jekyllrb.com/" target = "_blank">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator that includes built-in hosting support for <a href = "https://pages.github.com/" target = "_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. The decision to use Jekyll and GitHub pages was a tactical one: in addition to the user-friendly nature of both tools, we wanted to ensure that our own tool – its code, documentation, etc. – was made available to users open-source, something that GitHub Pages readily supports. Within the Jekyll build environment, the structure of our tool was coded overwhelmingly with basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript, though we did occasionally use Liquid for the purpose of templating/automating. The content that populates our tool was written primarily using markdown. It should be noted that the ROADMAP team is especially grateful for the support of the <a href = "https://codepen.io/" target = "_blank">codepen</a> community, whose open-source visualizations provided fruitful starting points for the development of various “proof of concept” iterations that were designed to test the use of JavaScript to support different interactivity features (e.g., scrolling, click-throughs, etc.).

    <b>State of rare disease nonprofits in the US & drug repurposing    </b><br>
    From our crowdsourcing initiative, we identified 711 rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US. In the last 10 years there has been an explosion in the number of new rare disease nonprofit organizations, with over 56% of them being founded from 2011-2021. Interestingly, 416 (41.9%) of the organizations were started by loved ones of patients (parents, spouses, siblings, etc.) and 206 (20.8%) were started by the patients themselves. Out of the 711,

    <p>
        Utilizing the organization’s websites, our team of extractors identified how many stated that they utilize certain resources that may be important for an organization to be able to successfully support research projects in the future, such as:

    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            a biobank - 142 (20%) organizations

        </li>
        <li>
            a natural history registry or study - 291 (41%) organizations

        </li>
        <li>
            a SAB/MAB  - 423 (59.5%) organizations

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Interestingly for this project, our team found mentions of drug repurposing initiatives, off label use or treatment guidelines that included repurposed drugs among 135 (19%) organizations. Only 335 (47%) organizations had a formalized research agenda, while 234 (33%) mentioned formalized treatment guidelines for their rare disease of focus. 430 (60.5%) focus on a single rare disease and its subtypes, while 264 focus on multiple rare diseases (some organizations were very broad, focusing on either all rare diseases or both rare and common diseases).

        <section id = "off-label-use">
        <b>UpToDate dataset: Potential of Off Label Use        </b><br>
        The team of extractors extracted a total of 1,054 (542 unique) drugs for 68 rare diseases (while we started with 100 diseases, this number reduced due to combination of subtypes for the same rare disease and elimination of diseases which do not meet the official criteria for being considered “rare”). 926 drugs were listed as recommended or potentially helpful, 53 were not recommended. 702 (71.7%) were FDA approved for the rare disease in question, 203 (20.7%) were being utilized off-label, and 74 (7.6%) were not yet approved for anything in the US. Per rare disease, 304 (25.7%) unique drugs were recommended but either off label or not yet approved for anything in the US, which illustrates just how common off label drug use is and how huge the potential for drug repurposing is.

        <b>Survey insights: Rare Disease Nonprofits         </b><br>
        According to the data, out of 147 organizations, 127 support research, 58 are pursuing drug repurposing projects and 58 are not yet, but are interested in doing so. Out of the 58 which are pursuing drug repurposing (though only 40 organizations have provided a specific drug of focus), 15 have successfully met at least one endpoint. Only 6 drugs have made it to FDA approval, though it is worth mentioning that only 40 (43%) of drug repurposing projects in our data set FDA approval as their success endpoint goal. The most popular success endpoints selected were “Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms” (50 - 10 met), “Drug to provide significant improvement in quality of life” (50 - 8 met), and “Drug to be freely available to patients off label with safety / efficacy data” (47 - 2 met). This speaks to the need to have a broader definition of “success” other than FDA approval. 
    
    </p>

    <p>
        58 organizations are pursuing or have pursued drug repurposing projects in the past. 19 organizations have stated that they have pursued multiple drug repurposing projects, with an average of 3.84 projects per organization (range of 2-7), though most organizations only pursued two projects at a time. Out of the 58 organizations that are pursuing drug repurposing projects (or have in the past), only 17 systematically track off label drug use in their patient population. This is important to highlight since off-label data analysis was the third top drug identification method in our data, leading 14 organizations to identify 25 as promising for their rare diseases. 65.45% stated that they are interested in tracking this information in the future. 

    </p>


<p>
    Let’s now look closer at the 94 (76 unique) drugs which are in process of being repurposed by 40 organizations in our data. As discussed prior, we separated the timeline of a drug repurposing project into several stages:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Early stage: Securing funding, testing existing drugs in mouse or other animal models, trying to secure researcher interest to pursue, patient data collection, recruiting patients for clinical trials)

    </li>
    <li>
        Clinical trials: stage I, II, III clinical trials or analyzing clinical trial data 

    </li>
    <li>
        Late stage: submitting clinical trial data to FDA

    </li>
    <li>
        Endpoint:<br>
FDA approval
an alternative success endpoint (use of drug off label)
a subjective success endpoint (Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms, significant improvement in quality of life, increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality, provide cure of disease, provide prevention of relapse)
unsuccessful (project abandoned or FDA approval denied). 

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In our dataset, 28 drugs are in early stages, 27 - in clinical trials, 13 - in late stages. As mentioned earlier, only 6 drugs have so far made it to FDA approval for their new rare disease indication and many (21) have reached either an alternative or subjective outcome, meaning they are being used off label and having some sort of positive effect on the patients despite not having official FDA approval. 

</p>

<p>
    The most common drug identification method was preclinical/translational research (65 drugs). The other top choices were looking at drugs used in similar diseases (28), off-label use data analysis (24), high throughput drug screening (HTDS) (21) and literature review/meta-analysis (16). The least popular option was machine learning/artificial intelligence approaches (2), which may speak to the novelty of this approach and its slow integration into the existing research/repurposing processes or that it is mostly being utilized without the involvement of rare disease nonprofit organizations. It is also important to mention that 57 drugs utilized more than one identification method. The most common combination of methods was HTDS and Preclinical/Translational research (11 cases) and looking at drugs used in similar diseases and Preclinical/Translational (9 cases). This speaks to the value of pursuing multiple avenues at once and triangulating the findings from one method with another. It is also interesting to point out that the 11 drugs were identified as promising in different ways for different rare diseases.

</p>

<p>
    It is very interesting that the second top choice was looking at drugs used in similar diseases, as one of our research focuses was the levels of collaboration between different organizations, and we were specifically interested to see how much collaboration we would see among different rare disease nonprofits. 

</p>

<p>
    With the data from the collaboration section of the survey, we were able to build networks. Each node in a network represents an organization, and each edge signifying a connection between them, either an explicitly mentioned connection via the survey data or an affiliation edge which was later added by the research team. The nodes are colored by type of organization, with a distinction made between our participating rare disease nonprofit organizations, and other nonprofit organizations mentioned by the respondents:

</p>

    <img class = "img-fluid shadow-3-strong" src = "/assets/images/about/network-node.png"/>
    <figcaption>network node color legend

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    From looking at the network visualization, we can see that most of the rare disease nonprofit organizations in our data are actually part of one large “connected component”. A connected component means that there is a path between every pair of nodes. In other words, it is a group of nodes that are all reachable from one another by following the edges of the graph. The nodes here are sized by degree, with the largest two nodes being NORD and Global Genes, which is not surprising since these are large, umbrella organizations which each have hundreds of member organizations.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Additionally, since we asked organizations about the types of collaborations they are engaged in with their top 5 closest collaborators, we are able to view subsets of the networks based on the type of activity. For example, we can see that between organizations who share data, share resources and share knowledge about their experiences there is some overlap within the network, but there are some significant differences: knowledge sharing seems to be a lot more common overall and mostly between our rare disease nonprofit organizations (colored orange) and other nonprofit organizations (colored light blue), whereas data and resource sharing seems to be much more common between our rare disease nonprofit organizations (colored orange) and university/research centers (colored light green) and hospitals (colored brown).

    <p>
        Though many people equate drug repurposing with high throughput drug screening (HTDS), there are some concerns with how expensive HTDS projects can be and how much success they yield at the end (citation?). In our data, 21 drugs were identified via high throughput drug screens. 6 are still in early stages, 7 are in clinical trials, 4 are in late stages, while only 2 made it to FDA approval. 3 have made it to an alternative success outcome, while 6 have reached one of our “subjective” success outcomes, and 3 have been unsuccessful. 

    </p>

    <p>
        There are many ways we can conceptualize “success” in a drug repurposing project. One obvious and traditional marker is receiving FDA approval. Out of our 94 (76 unique) drugs, only 6 have made it to FDA approval: 

    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Dupilumab // Campaign Urging Research for Eosinophilic Disease // Eosinophilic diseases

        </li>
        <li>
            Selumetinib // Children's Tumor Foundation // Neurofibromatosis

        </li>
        <li>
            Alpelisib // CLOVES Syndrome Community // CLOVES syndrome

        </li>
        <li>
            Rituximab // International Pemphigus Pemphigoid Foundation // Pemphigus, Pemphigoid

        </li>
        <li>
            Sirolimus // LAM Foundation // Lymphangioleiomyomatosis

        </li>
        <li>
            Pazopanib // Cure HHT (NOTE - “Received FDA Breakthrough designation,” not FDA approval) // Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia

        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Looking closer at these 6 organizations, which have had a drug make it to FDA approval through drug repurposing, they are on average 26.7 years old (range: 11  - 44); their annual funding ranged from $100,000  to more than $5,000,000 (the most common selection was “$1,000,000 and $2,000,000”); and they have the following characteristics: all 6 have an SAB/MAB, 1 has a biobank, 4 have a natural history study, 4 have a formal research agenda, 2  have a patient registry, and 3 already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing. A testament to the dedication of their volunteers in the pursuit of success, one of these organizations has no full time staff, relying entirely on volunteer or part-time staff to achieve their success, while the other five have anywhere from 1 to 40 full time staff. 

    </p>

    <p>
        It is important to note that there are very many factors that affect whether a drug can ever get FDA approval that do not depend on its safety, efficacy and are beyond the control of a researcher or a rare disease nonprofit organization supporting a drug repurposing project. Notably the most important of these is the drug’s patent status, which affects the level of interest by a pharmaceutical company to invest time and money into supporting the FDA approval application. Thus, we consider FDA approval as not the best success metric if we consider that the most important outcome is getting treatments to rare disease patients with enough efficacy and safety data. 

    </p>

    <p>
        If we utilize the criteria of counting an organization as “successful” if they have met at least one subjectively-reported success endpoint (Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms, significant improvement in quality of life, increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality, provide cure of disease, provide prevention of relapse) for at least one drug, and counting all other organizations as “not yet successful”, we end up with 13 successful and 45 not yet successful organizations. Looking closer at the 13 successful organizations, they are on average 18.31 years old (range: 2-44); the majority (4 organizations, 30.77%) reported an annual funding between $100,000 and $500,00; and they have the following characteristics: 12 (92.31%) have an SAB, 5 (38.46%) have a biobank, 8 (61.54%) have a natural history study, 8 (61.54%) have a formal research agenda, 7 (53.85%) have a patient registry, and 5 (38.46) already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing (one organization has two FDA-approved drugs).  6 (46.15%) have no full time  staff, relying entirely on volunteer and/or part-time  labor to achieve their success.

    </p>

    <p>
        Among these 13 subjectively “successful” organizations, there are 45 unique drugs being repurposed. The most common drugs among these organizations were Sirolimus (4 organizations) and Trametinib/Everolimus/Dupilumab/Bevacizumab (2 organizations each). The most common identification method for these drugs was Preclinical/Translational research (31), closely followed by data from similar diseases (20) and off-label use (17). Most of these drugs are currently in early stages, specifically the recruiting patients for clinical trials (18) stage. Their respective rare diseases have the following characteristics: 8 (61.54%) have treatment guidelines, 9 (69.23%) have an identified genetic mutation, 9 (69.23%) have an ICD code, 13 (100%) have animal models, 10 (76.92%) have cell lines developed, 4 (30.77%) have predictive biomarkers and 6 (46.15%) have a clear understanding of etiology or disease pathogenesis.

    <b>Survey insights: Patients & Loved ones    </b><br>
    For rare disease patients and their loved ones (these stakeholders received the same set of questions) we were interested in their experience with off label drugs for their rare disease, including roadblocks in access, as well as their general attitude towards and comfort level with drug repurposing. 

</p>

<p>
    Generally, it seems that patients are not clearly aware of whether the drugs they are taking are FDA approved or off label, as 28.8% stated they are not aware of the status of the drug that they are on.

</p>

<p>
    Most patients (76.6%)  have heard of the term “off label” but have not talked to their doctor about using an off label drug, nor are most of these patients  (66.5%) aware of other patients using off label drugs. Generally, patients are very willing to follow their doctor's recommendations based on trust with their doctor, as well as drug safety and efficacy. Most patients (strictly among those who said they received the survey from one of the 58 rare disease non profits that reported being involved in drug repurposing)  were not aware of the term drug repurposing and are not aware of any initiatives being done for their rare disease, [this may include patients from organizations which are currently supporting drug repurposing projects]. They stated that they were extremely interested in it based on the definition we provided in the survey. The most important aspect that interested patients was having more treatment options available and strongly agreed to the idea that drug repurposing is generally safe and necessary for their rare disease. Generally, patients reported little to no roadblocks in drug access, which is great to see, as roadblocks such as insurance not approving off-label drugs can greatly affect patient access to potentially life-saving treatment, even if the drug repurposing process has been successful.

    So, overall, it seems that the patients and loved ones who participated in the survey have a positive attitude towards drug repurposing, but lack a deep understanding of what is being done for their disease and what off label drugs are promising or being pursued. This can be useful for rare disease nonprofits to be aware of in crafting their communication materials, to make sure that their patient populations are aware of all the research being pursued and all treatment options available with sufficient safety and efficacy data, even if they are not yet FDA-approved for their rare disease.

    <b>Survey insights: Physicians </b><br>
    For physicians, we were mainly interested in the frequency and ​factors taken into consideration when deciding to prescribe a drug off-label, off-label drug prescription practices for the rare diseases they treat, as well as their levels of involvement in clinical trials for rare diseases. 

</p>

<p>
    Due to the low number of physicians who participated in the survey (only 23), it is difficult to make any generalizations based on the data. But, at least the physicians in our dataset, 70.6% of them were aware of off label drug options for the rare diseases that they treat and they prescribe them often. They stated they were “somewhat effective” at both reducing overall symptoms, preventing worsening of the patients’ rare disease and improving your patients’ overall state of health. 80% of the physicians stated that the current off label options do not completely address all of the challenges associated with your patients’ rare disease.

<p>
    The participating physicians were familiar with drug repurposing, were aware of ongoing clinical trials and have previously referred eligible patients to them. 100% of our participating physicians stated that, if the opportunity presented itself, they would be willing to be a co-investigator on a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a drug that is being repurposed for a rare disease that they treat.

    <b>Survey insights: Researchers    </b><br>
    For researchers, we asked questions regarding their involvement in research projects to advance drug repurposing for any rare diseases, what their motivations are and what challenges they’ve encountered. 

</p>

<p>
    We had 43 researchers participate in the ROADMAP survey, and most of them stated that they are extremely interested in drug repurposing and find it extremely important. Those that have done research related to drug repurposing in the past or are currently, which was 31 (96.9%) researchers, said that their top motivation is its impact to patients. Their top difficulties were lack of funding, lack of collaboration/support from a pharmaceutical company and lack of biospecimens. Importantly, 86.1% of the researchers said that they engage with the rare disease patient population in the research process.
