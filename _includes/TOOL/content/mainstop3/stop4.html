                Utilizing AI and machine learning (ML) to identify potential repurposed treatments is a relatively new approach, coming from information and computer science and “big data” computational analysis. It can be done in a variety of ways, which are constantly evolving and improving with the improvement in models, computational abilities. A few of these are:

            </p>
            <p>
                using natural language processing (NLP) and other techniques to analyze large amounts of scientific literature and identify potential connections between different diseases, treatments, and drugs. This approach can help to identify new uses for existing drugs and therapies, and can also help to identify new drug targets and mechanisms of action.

                analyzing large amounts of data from various sources, such as electronic health records, clinical trial databases, and drug databases to try to find connections between them. This approach can help to identify new connections between different diseases, treatments, and drugs, and can also help to identify new drug targets and mechanisms of action

        Each of these approaches can help to accelerate the drug discovery and development process and lead to the identification of new treatments for a wide range of diseases and conditions, though they do require a specialized skill set and access to huge amounts of data.

        Using ML/AI approaches was the least utilized type of drug identification methods for drug repurposing projects in our data (<b>2</b> drugs). Out of these, <b>1</b> drug is in early stages and <b>1</b> is in clinical trials; <b>none</b> have yet made it to late stages, FDA approval, or are being used off label with some measure of benefit; and <b>none</b> have been unsuccessful.
