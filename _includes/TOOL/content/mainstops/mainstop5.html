                    Once the drug is shown to be promising and potentially safe and effective for a given rare disease, it must be tested in humans to demonstrate whether it is effective or not. This is traditionally done either through clinical trial testing and/or real world off-label use. Clinical trials provide robust data on the drug's safety and efficacy in human subjects with the disease, and are necessary for obtaining FDA approval and making the drug available to patients, while off-label use tracking can provide additional data on the safety and efficacy of the drug in real-world settings.

    Supporting drug repurposing can include a number of challenges related to the clinical trial process itself, which is complex, costly, time-consuming, high-stakes, and requires close coordination of many different stakeholders of varying levels of commitment and interest. Some important roadblocks to keep in mind and be prepared for include:

        <p>
            Clinical trials can be expensive and time-consuming. Locating the appropriate clinic and/or physician to conduct the clinical trial may be especially challenging for rare diseases, particularly those that lack a disease expert who is also a clinical trialist.

            <b>The design of clinical trials</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The design of the trial poses particular challenges with rare diseases, as the selection of appropriate endpoint measures can present challenges due to limited data available or a small patient population. Many rare diseases lack a measurable biomarker, which may make endpoint selection more difficult. When studying a drug in a new disease population, there may be a requirement to redose or reformulate the drug, adding complexity to the clinical trial design and potentially requiring additional safety studies.

            <b>Lack of a sufficient patient population to study</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are very few patients who are officially diagnosed with the rare disease, and/or the small patient population may already be receiving the repurposed drug off-label, which can make it difficult to conduct robust clinical trials and gather enough data to support the repurposing of drugs. There might also be limited awareness about the trial, or lack of understanding of the risks and benefits involved. Patients may be hesitant to participate in a trial if they have a distrust of the medical system in general or they fear losing access to the treatment they are currently receiving or go on a treatment during the trial which they might not have access to afterwards. There also may be clinical trials already ongoing, which may further reduce the patient population eligible to enroll in new trials

            Working with an international patient population can also present challenges in terms of coordinating care and communicating effectively with patients and families with different language needs, different religions and cultural backgrounds. There is also variation in regulations, drug access, research standards and regulatory requirements, and other factors across different countries, which can make it difficult to conduct clinical trials in multiple sites and ensure that all patients have access to the same treatment options during the trial and after its completion.

            <b>Complexities of rare diseases</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Many rare diseases have several subtypes, symptoms across multiple organ systems, severity of the symptoms, speed of disease progression, or co-occurring conditions which can make it difficult to discern the effects of a repurposed drug in the clinical trial. Due to the rare disease itself, it may be difficult for patients to understand the trial, comply with its requirements, or travel to a trial site; patients who are particularly sick may not enroll in a clinical trial, particularly if the drug is available off-label outside of the trial.

            <b>Blood-brain barrier penetration and other disease-specific considerations</b>

        <p>
            The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a specialized system of blood vessels and cells that surrounds the brain and spinal cord that helps protect the brain from harmful substances. This barrier is selectively permeable, which means that some substances can pass through it, while others can't. This means that even if a drug has been repurposed and has been shown to be effective in treating a certain condition, it may not be able to reach the target area in the brain, making it less effective.

        <p>
            Navigating the complex requirements for conducting clinical research can be a huge roadblock for organizations who do not have a core team member who has a research background and/or experience with clinical trials. This is important to consider if the organization is planning to submit the results of the clinical trial to the FDA for approval, as there are certain clinical trial design requirements that need to be implemented.

            These limitations can make it difficult for a rare disease nonprofit to support large-scale clinical trials for repurposing. However, by establishing collaborations among rare disease nonprofits, physicians, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies, organizations can work to overcome some of these challenges: pooling resources and expertise, identifying potential trial sites, and creating networks to connect with patients and families affected by rare diseases with ongoing trials for which they are eligible for.

<p>
    Another strategy is to leverage innovative trial designs, such as basket and umbrella trials, which allow for testing multiple treatments for multiple rare diseases or subtypes in one trial. Furthermore, utilizing digital health technologies, such as telemedicine and remote monitoring, can help overcome geographic and logistical barriers to patient recruitment and retention, while also reducing costs. Regulatory agencies may be more receptive to innovative clinical trial designs for rare diseases, and engaging with them early in the process can help ensure that trial design and data collection are aligned with their requirements. By leveraging patient and community engagement and various types of partnerships, rare disease nonprofits can work to overcome these barriers and advance progress in their rare disease space.
