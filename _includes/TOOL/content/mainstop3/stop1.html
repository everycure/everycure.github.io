                <b>High-throughput drug screening</b>
                (HTDS) is a method of rapidly screening anywhere from hundreds to thousands of compounds from existing libraries to identify those that have a specific biological activity at the model organism, cellular, pathway, or molecular level. This process is used in early stages of drug discovery to identify potential drug candidates and in drug repurposing to identify new potential uses for existing drugs. Compounds that affect the target in an anticipated way are called hits, and the screens may be restricted to compounds that have already been tested in humans, thereby reducing the need for extensive preclinical tests. These hit compounds become candidates for further repurposing research. A HTDS can produce a huge number of hits, which should then be validated to identify which are most promising to move forward with.

        It is important to remember that many hits in high-throughput drug screens do not end up being effective in patients with the given disease. This discrepancy may be due to the cell line or model system not being a good representation of the patient's disease, issues with dosing and timing of administration, or other issues. It is also important to consider that it can be quite expensive, as it requires access to a highly specialized screening facility and compound libraries, which are often offered by Contract Research Organizations (CRO) or core facilities.

        Among the
        <b>21</b> drugs identified via high throughput drug screens in our ROADMAP survey,
        <b>6</b> are still in early stages,
        <b>6</b> are in clinical trials,
        <b>5</b> are in late stages,
        <b>1</b> has made it to FDA approval, while
        <b>6</b> are being utilized off label with efficacy/safety data and some subjective measures of benefit, and
        <b>3</b>
        have been unsuccessful.
