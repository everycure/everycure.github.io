            There are many ways we can conceptualize “success” in a drug repurposing project. One obvious and traditional marker is receiving FDA approval, but it is important to note that there are many factors that affect whether a drug can ever get FDA approval that do not depend on its safety, efficacy and are beyond the control of a researcher or a rare disease nonprofit organization supporting a drug repurposing project. Notably the most important of these is that pharmaceutical companies may choose to not invest time and money into supporting the FDA approval application. Thus, we consider FDA approval as one metric among others. The ultimate goal is to ensure that drugs that can be effective and safe for a rare disease are used for that rare disease, regardless of if it’s following an FDA approval, treatment guidelines changes, or off label use with some efficacy/safety data and measures of benefit.

    Some of these outcomes are final endpoints for a repurposing project, such as FDA-approval, while the others - off-label use and abandonment - can be reached at earlier stages in the process. A project can be abandoned at any stage, whereas off-label use can be considered a sufficient success endpoint whenever there is sufficient evidence on a drug’s safety and efficacy data, and it’s integrated into treatment guidelines. In some cases, this can be achieved without formal clinical trials.

    Even if a drug shows promising results in preclinical and/or clinical studies, it may still face roadblocks in the final outcome stages.

    The FDA approval process for repurposed drugs can be challenging and time-consuming. The FDA may require additional clinical trials and data to establish the safety and efficacy of repurposed drugs for new indications, the overall document which needs to be submitted can be hundreds of pages and can take months of work to put together. Without the support of a pharmaceutical company, the avenue for FDA approval is limited to a “citizen’s petition,” which does not have a good track record of being successful often. There is little/no FDA guidance for how rare disease nonprofits can best spearhead drug repurposing initiatives and many have had difficulty navigating the regulatory requirements for repurposed drugs. Repurposed drugs for rare diseases may qualify for orphan drug designation, FDA breakthrough designation, and other similar programs, which could provide financial incentives and expedited review. However, the criteria for qualifying for these statuses can be restrictive, and not all repurposed drugs may qualify.

    Additionally, even if the drug is FDA-approved or if available off-label with with some efficacy/safety data and measures of benefit, there are still some important roadblocks to consider:

            <b>Drugs may not work for everyone</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if drugs are successfully repurposed, they may not work for all patients, even if they have the same rare disease or even the same rare disease subtype. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as genetic variations, differences in the underlying causes of the disease, or other individual patient characteristics.

        <p>
            As with any treatment, repurposed drugs may have side effects, which can vary in severity. Some side effects may be minor and manageable, while others may be more severe and have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. This can be particularly challenging for rare disease patients, as there may be limited treatment options available and the side effects of the repurposed drug may outweigh the benefits for some patients.

            <b>Limited supply</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The supply of repurposed drugs can be a challenge as they were originally approved and manufactured for a specific indication. If the demand for the drug increases for a new indication or several new indications, it can be difficult to obtain enough supply if the manufacturing does not increase to meet this new demand. Moreover, if the drug is repurposed for more common diseases, such as COVID-19, it could affect the supply for rare disease patients.

            Physicians may not be aware of off-label uses of drugs for rare diseases if they do not see many patients with those conditions. Therefore, it is crucial for rare disease organizations to educate not only physicians in their network, but also the patient and loved one community about potential off-label treatment options, so that they can advocate for themselves and make informed decisions about their care.

            <b>The cost of drugs</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether off-label or FDA-approved, drugs can present affordability challenges for patients, particularly if they are not covered by insurance, or are covered by some insurance in some cases, while not in others.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    To work on overcoming these challenges, various strategies can be employed, such as the development of precision medicine approaches and additional biomarkers to identify patient subgroups that are more likely to benefit from the drug, as well as rigorous monitoring of patients for side effects, collaboration between drug manufacturers and rare disease nonprofits to increase drug supply, and education of physicians and patients on off-label uses of drugs for their rare diseases. Additionally, rare disease nonprofits can lobby for healthcare systems to improve insurance coverage for repurposed drugs and provide financial support to rare disease patients.
