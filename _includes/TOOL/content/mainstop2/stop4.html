        Rare disease nonprofits can provide direct patient support in the process of drug repurposing in various ways:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Provide treatment-related assistance</b> to patients by working with insurance companies to ensure coverage and promote patient access to new drugs that have been approved by the FDA, or off-label drugs which have been newly identified or being tested in the drug repurposing process.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Facilitate compassionate use access</b>, which allows patients with a serious or life-threatening disease to access investigational drugs outside of clinical trials, if the patients are not eligible or if the clinical trial does not happen for various reasons.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Provide access to a network of physicians</b> who are the most knowledgeable about the disease and the treatments available, including ones that are involved in drug repurposing projects. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Provide access to genetic testing</b> for patients to determine if they have a specific rare disease and help identify appropriate treatment options, which may lead to the identification of new drug repurposing opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Disseminate rare disease-specific educational information</b> to patients, families, and healthcare providers through various channels such as their website, social media, newsletters and patient conferences. This may include research results, updated treatment guidelines, lists of ongoing clinical trials, etc.  
        </li>
    </ul>
