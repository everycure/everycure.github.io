    The Repurposing Of All Drugs, Mapping All Paths (ROADMAP) project aims to identify the paths that can be taken to repurpose drugs, highlight the roles of various stakeholders, and centralize information on how to do this most effectively through an interactive “ROADMAP” tool. This project is supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI).

    In order to understand the most effective paths for rare disease drug repurposing, we needed to obtain data on the paths taken by rare disease stakeholders and the roadblocks they are facing. We began by identifying as many rare disease nonprofit organizations and potential stakeholders as possible, distributing a survey to these stakeholders, and performing in-depth interviews with a subgroup of representative stakeholders. Then, we utilized this information along with our experiences from rare disease drug repurposing to build out the ROADMAP. We have separated out this approach into the following six steps:
