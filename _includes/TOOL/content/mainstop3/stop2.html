  <p>
    <b>Pathogenesis targeting</b> refers to the process of identifying and targeting the underlying biological mechanisms or
    "pathways" that cause a disease. By understanding the pathogenesis of a disease, researchers can identify key
    molecules or processes that are involved in the disease process, and develop therapies that target these specific
    pathways. This could involve identifying the specific genetic mutations, immune cells, pathways or other changes
    that lead to the development and progression of a disease, and identifying existing therapies that target these
    changes.

    In the context of drug repurposing, the pathogenesis-targeting approach is a strategy that focuses on identifying
    drugs that target the underlying biological mechanisms of a disease, rather than focusing on the symptoms. This
    approach can be used to repurpose drugs that have already been approved for other indications, by identifying drugs
    that target the underlying mechanisms of a rare disease.

    For example, the CDCN uncovered that over activation of mTOR was important to the pathogenesis of Castleman disease
    and then found an approved mTOR inhibitor that it began testing on patients. More about this story <a href="https://cdcn.org/repurposecd/" target="_blank">here</a>.
