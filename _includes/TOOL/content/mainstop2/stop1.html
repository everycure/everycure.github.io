    Drug repurposing projects require financial resources. In order to support these projects, a rare disease nonprofit serves two intertwined functions, as a fundraising entity and as a fund-allocating entity.

            There are many ways an organization can raise money. One way to think about this is to focus on different entities that can contribute funds:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Patients & their families
            </li>
            <li>
                Individual large donors
            </li>
            <li>
                Government organizations
            </li>
            <li>
                Other nonprofit organizations
            </li>
        </ol>

    Fund-allocating
</h3>
<p>
    Once the funds are raised, there are a number of initiatives that a rare disease nonprofit can contribute funding to that can help to facilitate drug repurposing:
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="my-2">

        <ul class="circle">

            <li>Resource development (animal models, cell lines, biobanks, registries, etc.)</li>
            <li>Clinical trials</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="my-2">
        <p>
            <b>Community-focused activities</b>
        </p>
        <ul class="circle">
            <li>Collaborations between different rare disease organizations (pooling resources for either research, patient support, events, etc.)</li>
            <li>Grants to early career researchers to help grow researcher network</li>
            <li>Creation of research consortiums and meetings/events</li>
            <li>Supporting patient drug access</li>
            <li>Supporting a patient discussion platform</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="my-2">
        <p>
            <b>Patient care-centered activities</b>
        </p>
        <ul class="circle">
            <li>Establishment of expert panels to create treatment guidelines</li>

            <li>Genetic screening</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is also important to note that there are different approaches to how a nonprofit organization can select which research and researchers to fund.
</p>
<ul class="my-4">
    <li>
        The
        <b>traditional approach</b>
        involves an organization announcing a request for proposals (RFP) that invites researchers to submit a research proposal (a research question, approach to answering the question, and budget) that addresses the question or area of research described in the RFP. The organization then reviews and awards funds to the best proposal(s).
    </li>
    <li class="pt-3">
        An alternative to the researcher-centric model is the
        <b>“Collaborative Network Approach”</b>
        (16). It consists of eight steps and leverages and integrates the entire community of stakeholders — patients, loved ones, physicians and researchers — to identify and prioritize high-impact research questions. One of the most important steps of this approach is a crowdsourcing process, which “allows the entire community to identify the most clinically relevant and pressing questions; any idea can be translated into a study rather than limiting research to the ideas proposed by researchers in grant applications”.

        <p>
            Regardless of the amount raised or grant allocation approach, rare disease organizations can start to create a “seed” funding budget for research projects which either directly or indirectly relate to drug repurposing. Even if these are small grants that may not be enough to complete large-scale projects, these small grants can enable the first proof-of-concept studies to take place, enabling the researchers to then apply for larger grants from entities  like the FDA, NIH, etc.
