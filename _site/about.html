<p>
    There are anywhere from 7,000 to 10,000 rare diseases affecting approximately 30,000,000 individuals in the U.S.A. Despite significant investments of resources over the last several decades, most of these rare diseases do not have a single FDA-approved therapy, some estimate that over 90% of rare diseases lack an effective treatment (Kaufmann et al., 2018; Orphanet J Rare Dis). This fact highlights the failure of traditional research approaches to overcome the unique challenges faced by rare disease research. 
</p>

<p>
    In the rare disease space, rare disease non profit organizations are often key players in supporting the patient community through outreach, advocacy, fundraising, financial support, treatment guidance;, as well as supporting the researchers and physicians in advancing understanding and treatment options for the rare disease.
    
</p>

<p>
    Since the incentives to develop a new drug development for rare diseases are limited, drug repurposing provides a promising way to identify effective treatments for rare diseases. 

</p>

<p>
    The basic idea of drug repurposing is that once a treatment has been FDA-approved for one condition, it can be re-approved, or repurposed, to treat other conditions. The same goes for drugs developed for one condition, but proven ineffective or unsafe and thus never approved for the intended condition (this is sometimes referred to as “drug rescue”). 
</p>

<p>
    The repurposing process, in most cases, is considered to be a faster and cheaper way of getting treatments to patients compared to developing new drugs. Because the basic research on the properties of the compound has already been completed, as well as preliminary safety clinical trials, drug repurposing is able to skip many steps and costs. Depending on the new indication and how different it is from the original in both the target disease, population, dosages and modes of administration, drug repurposing could start from Phase II or Phase III clinical trials, and thus  it becomes a faster (only 1-3 years to implementation, comparing to the 13-15 years for new drug development) and cheaper ($300 million, compared to $2-3 billion for new drug development) (Pushpakom et al., 2019) option to get treatments to patients. 

</p>

<p>
    Additionally, because the repurposed drug has already been proven safe and effective, it has a higher likelihood to succeed in future clinical trials, compared to new, untested compounds - 1/10 success rate vs the 1/10,000 for new drug development (Stone, 2020). 

</p>

<p>
    However, the process has not received significantenough interest from relevant stakeholders or funding organizations. Lacking standard methods for implementation,, and most prior drug repurposing efforts are a result of serendipitous discovery rather than a systematic, intentional pursuit (Pushpakom et al., 2019). This is because many challenges exist in the drug repurposing space, namely:

</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        lack of a consensus of the roles that various stakeholders play (patient advocacy organizations, researchers, physicians, government, pharmaceutical companies, etc.)

    </li>
    <li>
        lack of a “roadmap” of how rare disease organizations should go about pursuing drug repurposing,

    </li>
    <li>
        lack of support (data, finances, resources, guidelines, etc.) during the drug repurposing process.
    </li>
</ol>

    The Repurposing Of All Drugs, Mapping All Paths (ROADMAP) project aims to answer some fundamental questions about the experience of drug repurposing for rare disease nonprofit organizations and their relevant stakeholders and to design a solution to some of the challenges rare disease organizations are facing through the creation of this interactive “ROADMAP” tool. This project is supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI).

        <h2>Crowdsourcing data</h2>
        <p>
    <b>All Rare Disease Nonprofit Organizations in the US
    </b><br>
    The first required dataset we needed was a comprehensive list of all rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US. From here we hoped to gain and an understanding of how many of them support research in general and drug repurposing in particular. We quickly discovered this dataset did not exist. In order to gather this data, we put out a call to assembled a team of volunteers through various social networks. We onboarded a small team of volunteers and commenced the first step of our crowdsourced data collection, which consisted of combining several existing lists of organizations (NORD members, Global Genes members, etc.). and The team then performedming additional searches to try to find any other lists or organizations which we could include (. The final list consisted of 982 organizations. 

</p>

<p>
    Next, a larger team of 70+ volunteers spent seven months (05/18/2021-12/16/2021) extracting data from the websites of these organizations, looking for:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Whether the organization satisfied our inclusion criteria: US-based, registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, focused on one or more rare diseases (one that affects less than 200,000 people in the US (Orphan Drug Act, 1983)) and having an active website.

    </li>
    <li>
        Basic organizational info: year of founding, name & contact information of founders

    </li>
    <li>
        Information as to the organization’s resources: conference, research agenda, biobank, registry, natural history study, etc.

    </li>
    <li>
        Whether the rare disease has treatment guidelines, or whether it is known that it is caused by a genetic mutation

    </li>
    <li>
        Any mention of drug repurposing, and if so - which drug(s) were pursued

    </li>
    <li>
        Any mention of partnerships or collaborations with other organizations 

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    As a result of this exercise, 711 organizations were confirmed as rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US with active websites as of 12/2021. This dataset has been made available open-source at [url here]. 

</p>

<p>
    <b>
        UpToDate Data on Off-label use

    </b><br>
    Separately, we onboarded a team of 10 extractors which had some medical expertise or medical educational background. We took a subset of 100 rare diseases from our ROADMAP survey data and conducted an extraction process of identifying whichhow many of these rare diseases had off-label drugs as a part of the official treatment guidelines on UpToDate.com, a well known and trusted electronic clinical resource tool for physicians. From 2/17/2022 to 7/14/2022, the team extracted every drug mentioned on the UpToDate page regarding a specific rare disease in the list and coded the drug entry on its “context” and “status”:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        “Context” refers to how the drug was mentioned on the UpToDate page. The options were “Context: Drug is recommended or listed as potentially helpful” and “Drug listed as does not work for this disease AND/OR no longer given AND/OR not recommended”. 

    </li>
    <li>
        “Status” refers to the drugs’ approval status. The options were “FDA approved for another disease”, “FDA approved for this rare disease” and “Not FDA approved for anything”. 

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The goal of this data extraction was to understand the current state of rare disease treatment. A commonly used statistic  that is utilized everywhere is that 95% of rare diseases do not have an FDA approved treatment. As far as we know, this statistic is never cited to any original research or dataset, so it is not clear how accurate  or up to date it is. Furthermore, it does not tell us how many of these rare diseases have off-label (FDA approved for another disease, but not FDA approved for that rare disease) treatments available for them. This is crucial information for us to understand the state of rare disease treatment in the US and the need for drug repurposing.

      <section id="section-5">
        <h2> Survey execution</h2>
        <p>
    We designed a comprehensive survey and implemented itn with the Qualtrics platform, which includedwith question sections for several different stakeholder types: (1) rare disease nonprofit organization leaders, (2) rare disease patients, (3) rare disease patients’ loved one (parent, spouse, friend, sibling, etc. of a rare disease patient), (4) physicians who treat rare diseases, (5) rare disease researchers. 

</p>

<p>
    Any member of the leadership team of a US-based rare disease-focused nonprofit organization were able to participate in this research project. They were then invited to directly reach out to their US-based patient, loved one, physician and researcher network and invite them to take the survey. Since rare diseases predominantly affect children, we allowed participants under 18 to participate in the project through an adult loved one who provided informed consent and took the survey. Additionally, since many rare diseases cause physical and cognitive disabilities, we allowed those patients to also participate in the survey through a loved one, regardless of the patient’s age in that case. Also, we included an option for patients and loved ones to participate in Spanish, in order to be as inclusive as possible.since we anticipated that a large portion of the population might not be fluent English speakers. 

</p>

<p>
    Each of these stakeholders had a unique insight into drug repurposing for rare diseases that we wanted to capture: 

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        For rare disease nonprofit organization leaders :we were focusing on capturing their organizational characteristics (age, funding, staff size, etc.), level of resources (biobank, patient registry, natural history study, scientific advisory board. etc), rare disease state of research (availability of treatment guidelines, diagnostic criteria, ICD code, biomarkers, etc.), information on any FDA or off label drugs being utilized for their rare disease of focus as well as their efficacy, availability and access, their , and drug repurposing experience, including challenges they’ve encountered, support they need, and who was in their collaboration network. 

    </li>
    <li>
        For rare disease patients and their loved ones (these stakeholders received the same set of questions): we were interested in their experience with off label drugs for their rare disease, including roadblocks in access,  as well as their general attitude towards and comfort level with drug repurposing. 

    </li>
    <li>
        For physicians,: we were mainly interested in the frequency and ​factors taken into consideration when deciding to prescribe a drug off-label, off-label drug prescription practices for the rare diseases they treat, and as well as their levels of involvement in clinical trials for rare diseases. 

    </li>
    <li>
        For researchers,: we asked questions regarding their involvement in research projects to advance drug repurposing for any rare diseases, what their motivations are, what challenges they’ve encountered. 

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <b>Preliminary Interviews</b><br>
    We conducted 10 preliminary semi-structured interviews with a selection of rare disease nonprofits. The goals of these meetings waswere to gatherget their general thoughts about the project and obtain their feedback on theour survey drafts. This information was used to refine the survey and communication materials.

</p>

<p>
    <b>Survey Dissemination</b><br>
    Our contract list was created by using the As described in a prior section, we had previously compiled a comprehensive list of US-based rare disease organizations (as described in prior section) and then. We had also collectinged email addresses from these organizations’ websites. This contact list was utilized to email an invitation to participate in the project. We sent 755 invitations to participate (39 of the emails had issues and were not delivered). Since this project is supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the survey was also disseminated by the CZI leadership team to the organizations as a part of their <a href = "https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/rare-as-one/" target = "_blank">Rare As One initiative</a>. 

</p>

<p>
    The survey was officially launched on 9/29/2021 and stayed open for data collection until 1/6/2022. Because the survey included several sections and many of the respondents represented multiple stakeholders and were able to opt into multiple sections at once, we opted to mark all surveys in progress as “complete” at the end of the data collection period in order to gather the most data possiblenot lose completed sections if the respondents opted into several sections and did not complete one or more. In total, we collectedreceived 1,923 total survey responses (completes and incompletes), which, after data cleaning and deduplication, included 147 organization representatives, 340 patients, 170 loved ones, 23 physicians and 43 researchers. According to our crowdsourced data, there are 711 active rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US. This means that theseour 147 organizations account forconstitute 20.7% of the total sample size and response rate, which is significant. Though there is an obvious selection bias to organizations who are interested or pursuing drug repurposing to take our survey, we are confident that we capturedwere able to capture a good variety of organizations based on a numbervariety of different characteristics.

</p>

<p>
    <b>Follow up Survey
    </b><br>
    During early stage analysis, an error in the Qualtrics platform was identified in which a significant section of the patient/loved one survey was not shown to any participants. Because the participants in the survey were able to voluntarily consent to email follow ups and provide their email addresses, those participants who opted into the patient/loved one survey and provided consent and contact information were then sent a follow up survey which contained these questions. 344 patients and loved ones were contacted to participate in the follow up survey, 200 responded and we were able to successfully match 191 to their original responses, 156 of which remained after data cleaning and became a part of the full dataset for analysis.

      <section id="section-6">
        <h2>Survey data analysis</h2>
        <p>
    The CDCN team did extensive data cleaning and analysis of the survey data. Most of the work was completed using a combination of Google Sheets and R studio (citation), packages:  tidyverse, stringr, dplyr, and googlesheets4.

</p>


<p>
    <b>Data cleaning</b><br>
    The data cleaning process consisted of five approaches, which were executed concurrently:

</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Filtering based on inclusion criteria

    </li>
    <li>
        Deduplication and merging

    </li>
    <li>
        Name cleaning and translations 

    </li>
    <li>
        (Re-)classification and categorization 

    </li>
    <li>
        Data changes, corrections, and updates 

    </li>
</ol>


<h4>
    1. Filtering based on inclusion criteria

</h4>

<p>
    Organizations were removed from the final dataset for the following reasons:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Organization was not a registered 501c3 nonprofit
    </li>
    <li>
        Organization does not support a rare disease
    </li>
    <li>
        Organization did not meet US location criteria
    </li>
    <li>
        Data submitted to Qualtrics after completion deadline
    </li>
    <li>
        Progress less than 10% survey completion
    </li>
    <li>
        Did not consent / did not answer consent question
    </li>
    <li>
        Did not answer any questions associated with stakeholder sections
    </li>
    <li>
        Data was a duplicate marked for removal (see “Deduplication and merging” for details)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In total, 1,324 entries (out of an original 1,929) were removed from the dataset, leaving 605 entries that qualified to remain in the final dataset.

</p>



<h4>
    2. Deduplication and merging

</h4>

<p>
    By “deduplication,” we are referring to the process of removing duplicate data in two types of cases:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Cases where the same individual completed the survey twice. 

    </li>
    <li>
        Cases where representatives from the same rare disease nonprofit completed the rare disease nonprofit stakeholder section of the ROADMAP survey. 

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    To identify cases where the same individual completed the survey twice, we looked for duplicate email addresses and/or IP addresses, as there was no other identifiable data collected via the survey. To identify cases where multiple rare disease nonprofit representatives completed the survey, we looked for rare disease nonprofit name matches among those who opted into the associated section of the survey. 

</p>

<p>
    When the same individual completed the survey twice, we identified mismatches between their survey responses, if any, and manually reconciled these differences by combining information to make entries as complete as possible. , and Wwwe alsoe also resolved any contradictions and inconsistencies between entries that we identified. 

</p>

<p>
    There were someIn cases where multiple rare disease nonprofit representatives completed the survey for the same organization, causing thise deduplication process to bewas a bit  more complex. First, we compared the completion rates on these entries; entries with higher progress were automatically selected over entries with lower progress. In cases where the completion rate of each entry was equal (e.g., 100%), we compared the titles of each representative. In cases where one entry’s representative had clear seniority (founder, CEO, executive director), we kept that entry. In a select handful of cases where both the progress and participant hierarchical standing were equal, we followed the same process described prior and manually reconciled any differences identified.

</p>

<b>ADD TABLE</b>

<p>
    The merging procedure refers to the process of combining the data from the follow up survey with the original survey data as described in a prior section. We began with 200 follow-up survey entries, and we successfully matched 191 of these entries to their corresponding ROADMAP survey entries. To do so, we compared the IP and email addresses from the original and follow-up surveys, and we merged entries where matches were found. We then isolated the data on which drugs patients from each survey reported taking. We compared groupings of drugs, and combined entries where unique matching pairs were found. Ultimately, we discarded 9 follow-up survey entries that could not be matched to the original survey data via IP/email addresses or drug names.

</p>

<p>
    It should be noted that while 191 successful matches were made, only 156 entries were ultimately combined with their original ROADMAP survey data. This is because 35 of the follow-up survey entries were from respondents whose entries were removed from the dataset during the inclusion filtering process outlined in “Filtering based on inclusion criteria” and “Deduplication and merging” sections. 

</p>

<h4>
    3. Name cleaning and translations

</h4>

<p>
    We reviewed and cleaned all manually-inputted job titles, specialties, organization names, disease names, and drug names. While each process varied in its scale (whereas there were only a few unique specialties to clean, there were hundreds of drug names to clean) and scope (e.g., drug/disease name cleaning efforts were extended to additional projects), the actual cleaning process was nearly identical across each cleaning activity. 

</p>

<p>
    Each step in the cleaning process required isolating unique names, and then developing a “key-pair” dictionary with a column for the original name, and a column for its (optional) replacement.  Members of the ROADMAP team, including volunteers, would then review the original names, identify inaccuracies and inconsistencies, and generate a final list of accurate replacements. In some cases, data was marked for removal (e.g., if a disease listed was not rare, or a drug listed as FDA-approved turned out to not be FDA-approved). Any use of brand name drugs were replaced with their generic name, and the names of pharmaceutical salts were removed as well. Acronyms were avoided whenever possible. Each dictionary was imported into R and used to clean the corresponding survey data. 

</p>

<b>ADD TABLE</b>

<p>
    Two participants who met our inclusion criteria completed the Spanish-language version of the survey. To ensure that their data would be represented in our analysis, we translated their survey responses into English. In cases where translations of participant-entered text were required, two Spanish-speakers (one native speaker, one non-native speaker) reviewed each translation for accuracy.

</p>

<h4>
    4. (Re-)classification and categorization

</h4>

<p>
    For the purposes of analysis and visualization, we created new variables that were used to classify/categorize existing data. Examples include, but are not limited to:

</p>

<ul>
        <li>
            Creating new categories for existing questions based on responses provided in the “other” sections

        </li>
        <li>
            Classifying disease names
        </li>
        <li>
            Classifying drug repurposing stages, status, and progress
        </li>
        <li>
            Classifying job titles

        </li>
        <li>
            Creating new variables (e.g., indicating whether drugs are FDA-approved based on human review; indicating whether an organization is focused on multiple diseases)

        </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Additionally, some response categories were renamed, merged, and/or removed based on team expertise and consensus.

</p>

<h4>
    5. Data changes, corrections, and updates

</h4>

<p>
    We have made changes, corrections, and updates to our data on an ongoing, case-by-case basis. While we have made small updates to our patient, loved one, researcher, and physician data, the overwhelming majority of our updates have been made to our rare disease nonprofit survey data. For example, whenever a major drug status change was identified among our list of 147 rare disease nonprofits (e.g., a new drug being targeted for repurposing; a drug receiving FDA approval), we updated all survey question data corresponding to that drug. In a few instances where participant clarification was required to resolve inconsistencies, we reached out directly to rare disease nonprofits for their assistance using the email addresses that they provided. In some of these cases - such as when the participants directly let us know that the drug was listed in error - we would remove all data related to that drug from our dataset. Except for these major changes, we did not make updates based on any other status updates that were discovered throughout the research and interview process, and the dataset provides a snapshot of the state of drug repurposing as of survey date completion and some of the data may be or soon will be outdated.

</p>

<p>
    <b>Data analysis</b><br>
    The survey data analysis process mostly focused on:

</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Descriptive statistics
    </li>
    <li>
        Categorization
    </li>
    <li>
        Visualization
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>
    1. Descriptive statistics 

</h4>

<p>
    The use of descriptive statistics has been an essential component of the analysis process; it has involved the reporting of basic quantitative statistical data about the ROADMAP survey. Examples include frequencies, measures of central tendency, and correlations. Generally speaking, we summarized raw survey data in our descriptive analysis. In a handful of cases, however, we developed new variables and/or created aggregations of variables for the purposes of analysis. All descriptive statistics have been calculated using R and R studio (citation).  The overarching goal of this descriptive analysis has been to characterize the rare disease nonprofits who participated in the ROADMAP survey (their typologies; outcomes and endpoints; characteristics; resources; etc.). Below, we review the general process that we followed to visualize, report, and share our findings from the ROADMAP survey. We also explore in more detail how we used the descriptive data that we collected to answer essential questions about the drug repurposing process and the progress of RDNPs in their drug repurposing journeys.

</p>

<h5>
    General process
</h5>

<p>
    Most of the descriptive data that  we generated was  presented through barcharts, pie charts, and word clouds, among other visualizations. We relied primarily on  a tool called Google Data Studio (citation) to generate these visualizations, which focused primarily on showcasing aggregated frequencies  of selected survey options. In certain cases, multiple questions were combined and aggregated; in other cases, individual questions were broken down into multiple charts. . The Google Data Studio, available to explore here [LINK], is one of the ways that rare disease nonprofit organizations, as well as any other interested stakeholders, can  explore our dataset and use it to inform further research or generate new insights.

    <img class = "img-fluid shadow-3-strong" src = "/assets/images/about/gds.png"/>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h5>
    Drug Repurposing

</h5>

<p>
    In order to analyze the progress of RDNPs in the drug repurposing process, we categorized the various steps involved in this process into stages. The stages that we developed were based on several questions from the survey:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Early stage: Securing funding, testing existing drugs in mouse or other animal models, trying to secure researcher interest to pursue, patient data collection, recruiting patients for clinical trials)

    </li>

<li>
    Clinical trials: stage I, II, III clinical trials or analyzing clinical trial data 

</li>
<li>
    Late stage: submitting clinical trial data to FDA

</li>
<li>
    Endpoint:
<br>
FDA approval
an alternative success endpoint (use of drug off label)
a subjective success endpoint (Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms, significant improvement in quality of life, increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality, provide cure of disease, provide prevention of relapse)
unsuccessful (project abandoned or FDA approval denied). 

</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Once we had identified and classified these stages, we began to formulate specific questions about our data. While our general interest was to assess the relationship between organizational characteristics, drug identification methods, and stage(s) of progress, specific research questions included (but were not limited to): 

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        How many organizations had how many drugs in what stages currently?

    </li>
    <li>
        How each drug was identified and what stage is it in currently?

    </li>
    <li>
        How/Whether each organization's characteristics are related to the drug identification method used?

    </li>
    <li>
        How/Whether the drug identification method is related to the various types of “success” endpoints?

    </li>

</ul>

<p>
    To answer these questions, we developed cross-tabulations of our data. By “cross-tabulation,” we are referring to the process of taking data from an entire group, and then breaking this data into subgroups in order to look for patterns, trends, or other noteworthy observations. To be clear, this was a purely descriptive undertaking: we did not perform any kind of inferential or predictive statistics using our data. Instead, we focused on reporting raw frequencies, proportions, and percentages, and we used these numbers to help describe, characterize, and summarize our drug repurposing data, as well as answer the specific research questions outlined above. 

</p>

<p>
    One challenge that we had to address in developing cross-tabulations was that we were asking questions about two different units of analysis: in one case, drugs being repurposed (94 total); in another case, the organizations involved in drug repurposing (40 total). To address this, we made two separate sets of cross-tabulations, each taking a different unit of analysis. Both sets of cross-tabulations included the aforementioned list of drug repurposing stages (early, clinical trials, late, etc.). When taking repurposed drugs as our unit of analysis, we summarized this information on a per-drug basis. When taking organizations as our unit of analysis, we summarized this information on a per-organization basis. This required “flattening” the data of organizations repurposing multiple drugs into single yes/no responses. We therefore decided that when looking at this data on an organizational level, any “yes” responses from an organization’s survey data would overwrite any “no” responses, as our goal here was to understand whether they had reached a given stage at any point; we relied on the drug repurposing cross-tabulations for more fine-grained information about how many specific drug repurposing projects reached each stage.

</p>

<p>
    When taking organizations as our unit of analysis, we compared our stage data with our data on organizational characteristics/resources. When taking repurposed drugs as our unit of analysis, we compared our data on stages with our data on drug identification methods. In the table below, "drug repurposing stages are represented in the rows, while drug identification methods are represented in the columns.” Each stage / drug identification method is broken into a “yes” and “no” subcategory, where “yes” indicates that a survey-taker explicitly answered “yes” to the corresponding survey question(s), and vice versa for “no” selections. We filtered out cases where the question was left completely blank (instead of inferring, for example, that this indicates a “no”), meaning that our marginal totals (the sum of all cells in a given 2x2 contingency table) do not always neatly sum to 94/40. 

</p>

<p>
    Each set of 4 gray highlighted squares in the snapshot below represents a single 2x2 contingency table that we could study individually and/or compare against other 2x2 contingency tables. 

</p>

<figure class = " py-4">
    <img class = "img-fluid shadow-3-strong" src = "/assets/images/about/contingency-full.png"/>
    <figcaption>Snapshot of the contingency table looking at drug identification methods and where the drug is currently
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    For a concrete example of how the above contingency table is read, we can “zoom in” on the top-left 2x2 contingency table, which displays information about two subgroups of drugs being repurposed: those in the “early” stage of drug repurposing and those that relied on “medical data” in the drug identification process. Looking at the below table tells us the following information about the relationship between this specific stage and drug identification method:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        6 repurposed drugs are currently in the early stage of drug repurposing were identified using medical data

    </li>
    <li>
        22 repurposed drugs are currently in the early stage of repurposing, but were not identified using medical data

    </li>
    <li>
        19 repurposed drugs were identified using medical data, but are not in the early stage of repurposing

    </li>
    <li>
        47 repurposed drugs were not identified using medical data, and are not in the early stage of repurposing

    </li>
    <li>
        28 drugs in total are currently in the early stage of repurposing (66 are not)

    </li>
    <li>
        25 drugs in total were identified via medial data (69 were not)

    </li>
</ul>

<h4>
    2. Categorization

</h4>

<p>
    One of the important outcomes of the ROADMAP project was a comprehensive understanding of all the “menu” items in the drug repurposing process, namely all the steps involved and all the options that a researcher can pursue or a representative of a rare disease nonprofit can support. Based on our experience and expertise, the ROADMAP team implemented a preliminary list of options in the survey, but via user feedback from various stakeholders, we were able to build out a more detailed breakdown of both the stages involved in the drug repurposing process as well as the options that are available for selection within each step. This categorization was done through an ongoing manual, collaborative visualization exercise using the tool MIRO (citation), which allows for mind mapping, timeline building and other visualization techniques in an infinite, collaborative workspace. We also utilized this approach to merge the interview insights with the existing survey data, which we will describe in a later section. 

</p>


<figure class = " py-4">
    <img class = "img-fluid shadow-3-strong" src = "/assets/images/about/miro.png"/>
    <figcaption>Illustration of the categorization processes done in MIRO
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>
    3. Network Visualization

</h4>

<p>
    One of the sections of the rare disease nonprofit organization representative survey focused exclusively on their collaboration network. In this section, the rare disease nonprofit organization representatives were asked to list their top collaborator organizations by name, and then specify what kind of collaboration activities they were engaged in with them. From this data, we also built a network dataset of nodes (organization) and edges (the relationships between organizations). We visualized this network using a tool called Gephi (citation). This allowed us to gain a better understanding of the types of relationships going on between different rare disease nonprofit organizations, as well as their external links to research institutions, pharmaceutical companies and government organizations. 

</p>

      </section>

      <section id="section-7">
        <h2>Interview execution</h2>
        <p>
    From the 147 rare disease nonprofit organizations in our survey data, we developed a typology of organizations based on various internal characteristics and drug repurposing experience.

</p>


<figure class = " py-4">
    <img class = "img-fluid shadow-3-strong" src = "/assets/images/about/typology-full.png"/>
    <figcaption>Typology of organizations for interviewee selection [RDNP names hidden for data confidentiality]

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Based on the typology, we selected 32 rare disease nonprofit organizations for participation in the interview phase of the project. We selected all 15 rare disease nonprofit organizations which selected at least one subjective success endpoint to have been met, and 17 organizations where no subjective success endpoints have been met yet. Out of these 17, we selected a sample from each stage of the repurposing process, and organizations that were comparable by the other characteristics (age, funding level, staff size, etc.) We did comparisons of our selected organizations both internally (15 vs 17 organizations) as well as comparing them to the total 147, as well as those we selected for interviews vs those not selected (32 vs 115). Overall, we were satisfied with our selection, that it captured a good variability across all important characteristics.

    <p>
        We then invited a member of the leadership team of all 32 organizations to participate via email, and 25 agreed to participate and were interviewed. The ROADMAP project lead conducted all 25 60-minute semi-structured interviews with them over the course of two months via ZOOM. The interview protocol focused on questions regarding their experience of drug repurposing, based on a preliminary framework consisting of four stages: 1. Preparation, 2. Drug Identification, 3. Validations, 4. Clinical Use and 5. Optimal Utilization. Within each step, we generally discussed how they executed each step, how long each step took, how the decision was made as to what approach to take, what challenges they faced, what advice they have for other organizations, who they collaborated with, and what resources they utilized. In cases when organizations were in the process of repurposing multiple drugs, the interviewees were asked to discuss the ones that were either the farthest along in the process, or with which they had the most varied experiences, so that on aggregate, the ROADMAP would contain insights from as many varied experiences as possible. Because of this, even though 25 organizations were interviewed, we were able to capture the experiences of repurposing 75 drugs.

      <section id="section-8">
        <h2>Interview data analysis</h2>
        <p>
    The interview audio was transcribed and cleaned utilizing Otter.ai (citation), with a final manual review from research assistants and project lead to guarantee accuracy of transcript data. Then, the project  team utilized a tool called Dedoose (citation) to conduct an iterative thematic analysis of the interview transcripts (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The project lead identified and coded statements from the interview transcript that answered a research question and generated a list of themes from these codes; this resulted in 120 themes. The project lead and research assistant then synthesized the themes into five categories of findings: 1. General Description, 2. Insights, 3. Roadblocks, and 4. Support Options and 5. Resources. We then utilized a mind mapping software MIRO, as mentioned in previous sections, to identify and categorize data visually and collaboratively. This process was crucial in making sure our interview insights helped fill in any missing categories from our survey data, and provide additional advice or nuance which we were not able to capture via survey.

        <p>
    The qualitative insights from the interviews were then combined with the survey data and integrated into an interactive "ROADMAP" tool and data explorer interface.

    <b>The interactive ROADMAP tool
    </b><br>
    The ROADMAP tool was developed using <a href = "https://jekyllrb.com/" target = "_blank">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator that includes built-in hosting support for <a href = "https://pages.github.com/" target = "_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. The decision to use Jekyll and GitHub pages was a tactical one: in addition to the user-friendly nature of both tools, we wanted to ensure that our own tool – its code, documentation, etc. – was made available to users open-source, something that GitHub Pages readily supports. Within the Jekyll build environment, the structure of our tool was coded overwhelmingly with basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript, though we did occasionally use Liquid for the purpose of templating/automating. The content that populates our tool was written primarily using markdown. It should be noted that the ROADMAP team is especially grateful for the support of the <a href = "https://codepen.io/" target = "_blank">codepen</a> community, whose open-source visualizations provided fruitful starting points for the development of various “proof of concept” iterations that were designed to test the use of JavaScript to support different interactivity features (e.g., scrolling, click-throughs, etc.).

    <b>State of rare disease nonprofits in the US & drug repurposing    </b><br>
    From our crowdsourcing initiative, we identified 711 rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US. In the last 10 years there has been an explosion in the number of new rare disease nonprofit organizations, with over 56% of them being founded from 2011-2021. Interestingly, 416 (41.9%) of the organizations were started by loved ones of patients (parents, spouses, siblings, etc.) and 206 (20.8%) were started by the patients themselves. Out of the 711,

    <p>
        Utilizing the organization’s websites, our team of extractors identified how many stated that they utilize certain resources that may be important for an organization to be able to successfully support research projects in the future, such as:

    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            a biobank - 142 (20%) organizations

        </li>
        <li>
            a natural history registry or study - 291 (41%) organizations

        </li>
        <li>
            a SAB/MAB  - 423 (59.5%) organizations

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Interestingly for this project, our team found mentions of drug repurposing initiatives, off label use or treatment guidelines that included repurposed drugs among 135 (19%) organizations. Only 335 (47%) organizations had a formalized research agenda, while 234 (33%) mentioned formalized treatment guidelines for their rare disease of focus. 430 (60.5%) focus on a single rare disease and its subtypes, while 264 focus on multiple rare diseases (some organizations were very broad, focusing on either all rare diseases or both rare and common diseases).

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>UpToDate dataset: Potential of Off Label Use        </b><br>
        The team of extractors extracted a total of 1,054 (542 unique) drugs for 68 rare diseases (while we started with 100 diseases, this number reduced due to combination of subtypes for the same rare disease and elimination of diseases which do not meet the official criteria for being considered “rare”). 926 drugs were listed as recommended or potentially helpful, 53 were not recommended. 702 (71.7%) were FDA approved for the rare disease in question, 203 (20.7%) were being utilized off-label, and 74 (7.6%) were not yet approved for anything in the US. Per rare disease, 304 (25.7%) unique drugs were recommended but either off label or not yet approved for anything in the US, which illustrates just how common off label drug use is and how huge the potential for drug repurposing is.
    
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Survey insights: Rare Disease Nonprofits         </b><br>
        According to the data, out of 147 organizations, 127 support research, 58 are pursuing drug repurposing projects and 58 are not yet, but are interested in doing so. Out of the 58 which are pursuing drug repurposing (though only 40 organizations have provided a specific drug of focus), 15 have successfully met at least one endpoint. Only 6 drugs have made it to FDA approval, though it is worth mentioning that only 40 (43%) of drug repurposing projects in our data set FDA approval as their success endpoint goal. The most popular success endpoints selected were “Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms” (50 - 10 met), “Drug to provide significant improvement in quality of life” (50 - 8 met), and “Drug to be freely available to patients off label with safety / efficacy data” (47 - 2 met). This speaks to the need to have a broader definition of “success” other than FDA approval. 
    
    </p>

    <p>
        58 organizations are pursuing or have pursued drug repurposing projects in the past. 19 organizations have stated that they have pursued multiple drug repurposing projects, with an average of 3.84 projects per organization (range of 2-7), though most organizations only pursued two projects at a time. Out of the 58 organizations that are pursuing drug repurposing projects (or have in the past), only 17 systematically track off label drug use in their patient population. This is important to highlight since off-label data analysis was the third top drug identification method in our data, leading 14 organizations to identify 25 as promising for their rare diseases. 65.45% stated that they are interested in tracking this information in the future. 

    </p>


<p>
    Let’s now look closer at the 94 (76 unique) drugs which are in process of being repurposed by 40 organizations in our data. As discussed prior, we separated the timeline of a drug repurposing project into several stages:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Early stage: Securing funding, testing existing drugs in mouse or other animal models, trying to secure researcher interest to pursue, patient data collection, recruiting patients for clinical trials)

    </li>
    <li>
        Clinical trials: stage I, II, III clinical trials or analyzing clinical trial data 

    </li>
    <li>
        Late stage: submitting clinical trial data to FDA

    </li>
    <li>
        Endpoint:<br>
FDA approval
an alternative success endpoint (use of drug off label)
a subjective success endpoint (Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms, significant improvement in quality of life, increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality, provide cure of disease, provide prevention of relapse)
unsuccessful (project abandoned or FDA approval denied). 

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In our dataset, 28 drugs are in early stages, 27 - in clinical trials, 13 - in late stages. As mentioned earlier, only 6 drugs have so far made it to FDA approval for their new rare disease indication and many (21) have reached either an alternative or subjective outcome, meaning they are being used off label and having some sort of positive effect on the patients despite not having official FDA approval. 

</p>

<p>
    The most common drug identification method was preclinical/translational research (65 drugs). The other top choices were looking at drugs used in similar diseases (28), off-label use data analysis (24), high throughput drug screening (HTDS) (21) and literature review/meta-analysis (16). The least popular option was machine learning/artificial intelligence approaches (2), which may speak to the novelty of this approach and its slow integration into the existing research/repurposing processes or that it is mostly being utilized without the involvement of rare disease nonprofit organizations. It is also important to mention that 57 drugs utilized more than one identification method. The most common combination of methods was HTDS and Preclinical/Translational research (11 cases) and looking at drugs used in similar diseases and Preclinical/Translational (9 cases). This speaks to the value of pursuing multiple avenues at once and triangulating the findings from one method with another. It is also interesting to point out that the 11 drugs were identified as promising in different ways for different rare diseases.

</p>

<p>
    It is very interesting that the second top choice was looking at drugs used in similar diseases, as one of our research focuses was the levels of collaboration between different organizations, and we were specifically interested to see how much collaboration we would see among different rare disease nonprofits. 

</p>

<p>
    With the data from the collaboration section of the survey, we were able to build networks. Each node in a network represents an organization, and each edge signifying a connection between them, either an explicitly mentioned connection via the survey data or an affiliation edge which was later added by the research team. The nodes are colored by type of organization, with a distinction made between our participating rare disease nonprofit organizations, and other nonprofit organizations mentioned by the respondents:

    <img class = "img-fluid shadow-3-strong" src = "/assets/images/about/network-node.png"/>
    <figcaption>network node color legend

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    From looking at the network visualization, we can see that most of the rare disease nonprofit organizations in our data are actually part of one large “connected component”. A connected component means that there is a path between every pair of nodes. In other words, it is a group of nodes that are all reachable from one another by following the edges of the graph. The nodes here are sized by degree, with the largest two nodes being NORD and Global Genes, which is not surprising since these are large, umbrella organizations which each have hundreds of member organizations.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Additionally, since we asked organizations about the types of collaborations they are engaged in with their top 5 closest collaborators, we are able to view subsets of the networks based on the type of activity. For example, we can see that between organizations who share data, share resources and share knowledge about their experiences there is some overlap within the network, but there are some significant differences: knowledge sharing seems to be a lot more common overall and mostly between our rare disease nonprofit organizations (colored orange) and other nonprofit organizations (colored light blue), whereas data and resource sharing seems to be much more common between our rare disease nonprofit organizations (colored orange) and university/research centers (colored light green) and hospitals (colored brown).

    <p>
        Though many people equate drug repurposing with high throughput drug screening (HTDS), there are some concerns with how expensive HTDS projects can be and how much success they yield at the end (citation?). In our data, 21 drugs were identified via high throughput drug screens. 6 are still in early stages, 7 are in clinical trials, 4 are in late stages, while only 2 made it to FDA approval. 3 have made it to an alternative success outcome, while 6 have reached one of our “subjective” success outcomes, and 3 have been unsuccessful. 

    </p>

    <p>
        There are many ways we can conceptualize “success” in a drug repurposing project. One obvious and traditional marker is receiving FDA approval. Out of our 94 (76 unique) drugs, only 6 have made it to FDA approval: 

    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Dupilumab // Campaign Urging Research for Eosinophilic Disease // Eosinophilic diseases

        </li>
        <li>
            Selumetinib // Children's Tumor Foundation // Neurofibromatosis

        </li>
        <li>
            Alpelisib // CLOVES Syndrome Community // CLOVES syndrome

        </li>
        <li>
            Rituximab // International Pemphigus Pemphigoid Foundation // Pemphigus, Pemphigoid

        </li>
        <li>
            Sirolimus // LAM Foundation // Lymphangioleiomyomatosis

        </li>
        <li>
            Pazopanib // Cure HHT (NOTE - “Received FDA Breakthrough designation,” not FDA approval) // Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia

        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Looking closer at these 6 organizations, which have had a drug make it to FDA approval through drug repurposing, they are on average 26.7 years old (range: 11  - 44); their annual funding ranged from $100,000  to more than $5,000,000 (the most common selection was “$1,000,000 and $2,000,000”); and they have the following characteristics: all 6 have an SAB/MAB, 1 has a biobank, 4 have a natural history study, 4 have a formal research agenda, 2  have a patient registry, and 3 already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing. A testament to the dedication of their volunteers in the pursuit of success, one of these organizations has no full time staff, relying entirely on volunteer or part-time staff to achieve their success, while the other five have anywhere from 1 to 40 full time staff. 

    </p>

    <p>
        It is important to note that there are very many factors that affect whether a drug can ever get FDA approval that do not depend on its safety, efficacy and are beyond the control of a researcher or a rare disease nonprofit organization supporting a drug repurposing project. Notably the most important of these is the drug’s patent status, which affects the level of interest by a pharmaceutical company to invest time and money into supporting the FDA approval application. Thus, we consider FDA approval as not the best success metric if we consider that the most important outcome is getting treatments to rare disease patients with enough efficacy and safety data. 

    </p>

    <p>
        If we utilize the criteria of counting an organization as “successful” if they have met at least one subjectively-reported success endpoint (Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms, significant improvement in quality of life, increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality, provide cure of disease, provide prevention of relapse) for at least one drug, and counting all other organizations as “not yet successful”, we end up with 13 successful and 45 not yet successful organizations. Looking closer at the 13 successful organizations, they are on average 18.31 years old (range: 2-44); the majority (4 organizations, 30.77%) reported an annual funding between $100,000 and $500,00; and they have the following characteristics: 12 (92.31%) have an SAB, 5 (38.46%) have a biobank, 8 (61.54%) have a natural history study, 8 (61.54%) have a formal research agenda, 7 (53.85%) have a patient registry, and 5 (38.46) already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing (one organization has two FDA-approved drugs).  6 (46.15%) have no full time  staff, relying entirely on volunteer and/or part-time  labor to achieve their success.

    </p>

    <p>
        Among these 13 subjectively “successful” organizations, there are 45 unique drugs being repurposed. The most common drugs among these organizations were Sirolimus (4 organizations) and Trametinib/Everolimus/Dupilumab/Bevacizumab (2 organizations each). The most common identification method for these drugs was Preclinical/Translational research (31), closely followed by data from similar diseases (20) and off-label use (17). Most of these drugs are currently in early stages, specifically the recruiting patients for clinical trials (18) stage. Their respective rare diseases have the following characteristics: 8 (61.54%) have treatment guidelines, 9 (69.23%) have an identified genetic mutation, 9 (69.23%) have an ICD code, 13 (100%) have animal models, 10 (76.92%) have cell lines developed, 4 (30.77%) have predictive biomarkers and 6 (46.15%) have a clear understanding of etiology or disease pathogenesis.

    </p>

<p>
    <b>Survey insights: Patients & Loved ones    </b><br>
    For rare disease patients and their loved ones (these stakeholders received the same set of questions) we were interested in their experience with off label drugs for their rare disease, including roadblocks in access, as well as their general attitude towards and comfort level with drug repurposing. 

</p>

<p>
    Generally, it seems that patients are not clearly aware of whether the drugs they are taking are FDA approved or off label, as 28.8% stated they are not aware of the status of the drug that they are on.

</p>

<p>
    Most patients (76.6%)  have heard of the term “off label” but have not talked to their doctor about using an off label drug, nor are most of these patients  (66.5%) aware of other patients using off label drugs. Generally, patients are very willing to follow their doctor's recommendations based on trust with their doctor, as well as drug safety and efficacy. Most patients (strictly among those who said they received the survey from one of the 58 rare disease non profits that reported being involved in drug repurposing)  were not aware of the term drug repurposing and are not aware of any initiatives being done for their rare disease, [this may include patients from organizations which are currently supporting drug repurposing projects]. They stated that they were extremely interested in it based on the definition we provided in the survey. The most important aspect that interested patients was having more treatment options available and strongly agreed to the idea that drug repurposing is generally safe and necessary for their rare disease. Generally, patients reported little to no roadblocks in drug access, which is great to see, as roadblocks such as insurance not approving off-label drugs can greatly affect patient access to potentially life-saving treatment, even if the drug repurposing process has been successful. 

</p>

<p>
    So, overall, it seems that the patients and loved ones who participated in the survey have a positive attitude towards drug repurposing, but lack a deep understanding of what is being done for their disease and what off label drugs are promising or being pursued. This can be useful for rare disease nonprofits to be aware of in crafting their communication materials, to make sure that their patient populations are aware of all the research being pursued and all treatment options available with sufficient safety and efficacy data, even if they are not yet FDA-approved for their rare disease.

    <b>Survey insights: Physicians </b><br>
    For physicians, we were mainly interested in the frequency and ​factors taken into consideration when deciding to prescribe a drug off-label, off-label drug prescription practices for the rare diseases they treat, as well as their levels of involvement in clinical trials for rare diseases. 

</p>

<p>
    Due to the low number of physicians who participated in the survey (only 23), it is difficult to make any generalizations based on the data. But, at least the physicians in our dataset, 70.6% of them were aware of off label drug options for the rare diseases that they treat and they prescribe them often. They stated they were “somewhat effective” at both reducing overall symptoms, preventing worsening of the patients’ rare disease and improving your patients’ overall state of health. 80% of the physicians stated that the current off label options do not completely address all of the challenges associated with your patients’ rare disease. 

</p>

    <img class = "img-fluid shadow-3-strong" src = "/assets/images/about/phys-bar.png"/>
    <figcaption>Would you consider the off label drug you prescribe to completely address 
        all of the challenges associated with your patients’ rare disease? 
        
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    The participating physicians were familiar with drug repurposing, were aware of ongoing clinical trials and have previously referred eligible patients to them. 100% of our participating physicians stated that, if the opportunity presented itself, they would be willing to be a co-investigator on a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a drug that is being repurposed for a rare disease that they treat. You can explore the physician data on the Google Data Studio [LINK]  

</p>

<p>
    <b>Survey insights: Researchers    </b><br>
    For researchers, we asked questions regarding their involvement in research projects to advance drug repurposing for any rare diseases, what their motivations are and what challenges they’ve encountered. 

</p>

<p>
    We had 43 researchers participate in the ROADMAP survey, and most of them stated that they are extremely interested in drug repurposing and find it extremely important. Those that have done research related to drug repurposing in the past or are currently, which was 31 (96.9%) researchers, said that their top motivation is its impact to patients. Their top difficulties were lack of funding, lack of collaboration/support from a pharmaceutical company and lack of biospecimens. Importantly, 86.1% of the researchers said that they engage with the rare disease patient population in the research process.
