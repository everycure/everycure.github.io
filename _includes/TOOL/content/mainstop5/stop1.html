        Clinical trials are research studies that are conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of drugs, medical devices, or other interventions in humans, after preclinical work has been done to evaluate potential efficacy and safety. The clinical trial process is divided into several phases, each of which has a specific purpose and set of objectives:

                <b>1. Phase I clinical trials</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                These are the first studies in humans. They are usually small, short-term studies that involve a small number of healthy volunteers or patients. The main objectives of Phase I trials are to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes and excretes the drug) of the new intervention. This step is typically skipped for repurposed drugs that are already FDA-approved for another disease.

            </p>
            <p>
                These studies involve a larger number of patients and are designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new intervention. The main objectives of Phase II trials are to determine the optimal dosage and to assess the effectiveness of the new drug or device. In many rare diseases, this is the only clinical trial ever performed and a moderately sized clinical trial indicating that drug works is typically enough to change treatment guidelines and potentially lead regulators to approve the drug for this new use.

            <p>
                These studies are large, multicenter studies that involve hundreds or thousands of patients. They are designed to provide more robust data on the safety and efficacy of the new intervention, and to compare it to the current standard of care. The main objectives of Phase III trials are to confirm the effectiveness of the new drug or device and to further evaluate its safety profile. Phase III trials are typically not required for rare disease drug repurposing effort.

                These studies are done after the FDA approves a drug. These studies are called post-marketing studies, which are done to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the drug in the general population.

        Though some drug repurposing projects go through all 3 phases, most are able to skip
        <b>Phase I</b>
        since basic safety for the drug has already been established in prior research (though if the patient population is very different from the original, Phase I trials may be warranted). In some cases, only a single clinical trial (often considered “phase II”) is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a repurposed drug to change treatment guidelines and potentially lead regulators to approve the drug for this new use.
    </p>
    <p>
        After clinical trial completion, some researchers/organizations may proceed with submitting the data to the FDA to  decide whether to approve the drug or device for use in the new disease. However, other researchers/organizations do not submit data to the FDA and choose to publish the study in a medical journal article and use the data to support recommendations to use the drug “off-label”. This decision is based on the fact that the time and cost of clinical trials are significant, and the process of submitting the application to FDA is very difficult without the support of the pharmaceutical company who owns the drug patent. Even with support, it takes years for companies to put together the documentation packet, which is often several hundred pages long.

        As discussed in other sections, there is much complexity in the design, funding, recruitment and management of clinical trials. Here we would like to point out a few clinical trial designs which might be especially useful for repurposing work in rare diseases, as they are able to potentially save time and money, and benefit multiple patient populations simultaneously:

                also known as "single patient trials" are a type of clinical trial that are used to test the effectiveness of a drug in a single patient, rather than in a group of patients. These trials can provide personalized treatment options for that person, as well as provide vital insights into the disease and treatment effectiveness, and provide justification for conducting larger trial. This is an especially important option for ultra-rare diseases in which large-scale clinical trials are simply impossible or for rare disease organizations which cannot financially support clinical trials.
