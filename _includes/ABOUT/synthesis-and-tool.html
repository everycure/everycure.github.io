    The qualitative insights from the interviews were then combined with the survey data and integrated into an interactive "ROADMAP" tool and data explorer interface. One of the most important aspects of this project is that it can help the rare disease community, and that this data will be made available.

    Thus, the ROADMAP project has produced several deliverables:

    <b>The interactive ROADMAP tool
    </b><br>
    The ROADMAP tool was developed using <a href = "https://jekyllrb.com/" target = "_blank">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator that includes built-in hosting support for <a href = "https://pages.github.com/" target = "_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. The decision to use Jekyll and GitHub pages was a tactical one: in addition to the user-friendly nature of both tools, we wanted to ensure that our own tool – its code, documentation, etc. – was made available to users open-source, something that GitHub Pages readily supports. Within the Jekyll build environment, the structure of our tool was coded overwhelmingly with basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript, though we did occasionally use Liquid for the purpose of templating/automating. The content that populates our tool was written primarily using markdown. It should be noted that the ROADMAP team is especially grateful for the support of the <a href = "https://codepen.io/" target = "_blank">codepen</a> community, whose open-source visualizations provided fruitful starting points for the development of various “proof of concept” iterations that were designed to test the use of JavaScript to support different interactivity features (e.g., scrolling, click-throughs, etc.).
