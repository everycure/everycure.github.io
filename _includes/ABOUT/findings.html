        The survey and our additional crowdsourced data provided a lot of unique insights from a variety of rare disease stakeholders. We are currently in the process of writing and submitting a publication with our research findings. Once this publication is available open-source, it will be available to read <a href = "/resources.html">here</a>. Until then, we provide preliminary, high-level findings below from each of the types of datasets we gathered as a part of this project. The data can be explored in our survey insights page <a href="/survey-insights-welcome.html">here</a>.

    <p>
        From our crowdsourcing initiative, <b>711</b> rare disease nonprofit organizations were identified in the US and basic information was extracted from organizations’ websites. Interestingly, 56% of these organizations were founded between 2011-2021. <b>430 (60.5%)</b> organizations focus on a single rare disease and its subtypes, while <b>264</b> focus on multiple rare diseases (some organizations were very broad, focusing on either all rare diseases or both rare and common diseases). <b>416 (41.9%)</b> of the organizations were started by loved ones of patients (parents, spouses, siblings, etc.) and <b>206 (20.8%)</b> were started by the patients themselves.

    <p>
        Utilizing the organization’s websites, our team of extractors identified how many stated that they utilize certain resources that may be important for an organization to be able to successfully support research projects in the future, such as: <b>423 (59.5%)</b> organizations had a scientific advisory board, <b>335 (47%)</b> had a formalized research agenda, <b>291 (41%)</b> had a natural history study or registry, <b>234 (33%)</b> mentioned formalized treatment guidelines for their rare disease of focus, and <b>142 (20%)</b> had a biobank.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interestingly for this project, drug repurposing initiatives, off-label use or treatment guidelines that included repurposed drugs were found on <b>135 (19%)</b> organizations’ websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        The team of extractors extracted a total of <b>1,054</b> (<b>542</b> unique) drugs for <b>68</b> rare diseases (while we started with <b>100</b> diseases, this number reduced due to combination of subtypes for the same rare disease and elimination of diseases which do not meet the official criteria for being considered “rare”). <b>926</b> drugs were listed as recommended or potentially helpful, <b>53</b> were not recommended. <b>702</b> (<b>71.7%</b>) were FDA approved for the rare disease in question, <b>203</b> (<b>20.7%</b>) were being utilized off-label, and <b>74</b> (<b>7.6%</b>) were not yet approved for anything in the US. Per rare disease, <b>304</b> (<b>25.7%</b>) unique drugs were recommended but either off label or not yet approved for anything in the US, which illustrates just how common off label drug use is and how huge the potential for drug repurposing is.

        <h3>The state of drug repurposing projects, led by rare disease nonprofit organizations</h3>

        <p>
            Among the <b>147</b> organizations surveyed, <b>127</b> support research. <b>58</b> organizations are currently pursuing drug repurposing projects and another 58 are not yet, but are interested in doing so. Out of the 58 which are pursuing drug repurposing, only <b>40</b> organizations provided a specific drug of focus. This may indicate that the remaining <b>18</b> organizations are in preliminary stages and have not yet identified a specific drug yet. Out of the 40 that already have one or more drugs for repurposing, <b>14</b> have met at least one endpoint. There is a wide range in terms of what organizations selected as their success endpoint goal: “Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms” (<b>48</b> selected this endpoint - <b>17</b> reported that is has been met), “Drug to provide significant improvement in quality of life” (<b>48</b> selected - <b>11</b> met), and “Drug to be freely available to patients off-label with safety / efficacy data” (<b>47</b> selected - <b>2</b> met).
        </p>
        <p>
            While <b>5</b> drugs have made it to FDA approval, only <b>40 (43%)</b> of drug repurposing projects in our data even set FDA approval as their success endpoint goal. Thus, getting an FDA approval for the drug to be used in a new disease area is often less of a goal of interest than demonstrating it is effective and helping patients, which can be accomplished without an FDA approval (as long as it is approved for another disease and widely available).
        </p>
        <h3>
            Pursuit of multiple projects
        </h3>
        <p>
            Among the <b>58</b> organizations which reported to be currently pursuing or have pursued drug repurposing projects in the past, <b>19</b> organizations have pursued multiple drugs for repurposing, with an average of <b>3.84</b> projects per organization (range of <b>2 - 7</b>); most organizations only pursued two projects at a time, likely due to the financial limitations of supporting multiple complex projects. 
        </p>
        <h3>Off-label use tracking</h3>
        <p>
            “Off-label drug use” refers to when a drug is prescribed for a disease that it is not specifically approved for. Out of the <b>58</b> organizations that are pursuing drug repurposing projects (or have in the past), only <b>17</b> systematically track off-label drug use in their patient population. This is important to highlight since tracking off-label drug use is an important way to assess whether a repurposed drug is effective. Data on off-label drug use can also be used as a way to identify a drug for potential further repurposing research. In fact, data analysis of off-label drug use was the third most reported method for identifying a repurposed drug, helping <b>14</b> organizations to identify <b>25</b> drugs as promising for their rare diseases. Though the majority do not track off-label drug use at this time, <b>66%</b> stated that they are interested in tracking this information in the future.
        </p>
        <h3>Identifying a promising drug for repurposing</h3>
        <p>
            The most common method for identifying promising drug repurposing opportunities was preclinical/translational research (<b>66</b> drugs). This category can also be described as pathogenesis targeting, whereby the researcher identifies a potential problem underlying a disease (e.g., mTOR activation is increased in Castleman disease) and then matching a drug to reverse the problem (e.g., using an mTOR inhibitor to treat Castleman disease), which is then studied further in the laboratory. The other top choices were looking at drugs used in similar diseases (<b>29</b>), off-label use data analysis (<b>25</b>), high throughput drug screening (HTDS) (<b>21</b>) and literature review/meta-analysis (<b>16</b>). The least common option was machine learning/artificial intelligence approaches (<b>2</b>), which may speak to the novelty of this approach and its slow integration into the existing research/repurposing processes or that it is mostly being utilized without the involvement of rare disease nonprofit organizations. It is also important to mention that more than one identification method was employed to identify <b>57</b> drugs. The most common combinations of methods were: 1) <b>HTDS</b> and <b>Preclinical/Translational research</b> (<b>11</b> cases); and 2) <b>looking at drugs used in similar diseases</b> and <b>Preclinical/Translational</b> (<b>9</b> cases).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also interesting to point out that <b>11</b> drugs were identified as promising by multiple organizations using different drug identification methods. This speaks to the value of pursuing multiple avenues at once and triangulating the findings from one method with another.
        </p>
        <h3>Current stage of drugs being repurposed</h3>
        <p>
            Among the <b>94</b> (<b>76</b> unique) drugs which are in the process of being repurposed by <b>40</b> organizations, we categorized the drug repurposing project one of several stages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Early stage: Securing funding, trying to secure researcher interest to pursue, testing existing drugs in mouse or other animal models, patient data collection
            </li>
            <li>
                Clinical trials: Recruiting patients for clinical trials, executing clinical trials stages I, II, III
            </li>
            <li>
                Late stage: Analyzing clinical trial data, submitting for FDA approval, receiving FDA Breakthrough designation
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In our dataset, <b>25</b> drugs are in early stages, <b>28</b> are in clinical trials, <b>14</b> are in late stages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, we worked to develop several success outcome categories, which would include more than just official FDA approval and provide alternative ways to conceptualize and measure drug repurposing success for rare diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our resulting outcome categories include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>FDA approval</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Off-label use, with some subjective measure of benefit</b>
                (Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms, improvement in quality of life, increase life expectancy/decrease in mortality, cure of disease, prevention of relapse)
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Off-label use, without any subjective measure of benefit</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Unsuccessful (project abandoned or FDA approval denied)</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In our dataset, <b>36</b> drugs have reached an outcome (FDA approval / off-label use / unsuccessful) of interest. Only <b>5</b> drugs have so far made it to FDA approval for their new rare disease indication but 18 are being used off-label and having some sort of positive effect on the patients despite not having official FDA approval. <b>13</b> drugs were reported to have been abandoned. No drugs in our dataset fell into the third category, off-label use, without any subjective measure of benefit. Most drugs (<b>58</b>) are still in process, and have not yet achieved any of the defined endpoint categories.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>*Note: due to some overlap between the stage and the outcome categories, the number of drugs in the stages does not add up exactly to the ones marked as in progress in the outcome*</i>

        <h4>High-throughput drug screening</h4>

        <p>
            Though many people think of high-throughput drug screening (HTDS), the process whereby lots of drugs are tested on cells or other models from a given disease to see if anything brings about a change of interest, as the primary mechanism for identifying drug repurposing opportunities, it is clear from this survey that several other methods are used to identify repurposed treatments. In our data, <b>21</b> drugs were identified via high-throughput drug screens. Out of these drugs, <b>6</b> are still in early stages, <b>6</b> are in clinical trials, <b>5</b> are in late stages, and <b>1</b> has made it to FDA approval. <b>6</b> are being prescribed off-label, and <b>3</b> have been unsuccessful.
        </p>
        <h4>FDA-approval</h4>
        <p>
            Out of our <b>94</b> (<b>76</b> unique) drugs, only <b>5</b> have made it to FDA approval:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Dupilumab</b>
                // Eosinophilic diseases
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Selumetinib</b>
                // Neurofibromatosis
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Alpelisib</b>
                // CLOVES syndrome
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Rituximab</b>
                // Pemphigus, Pemphigoid
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Sirolimus</b>
                // Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Looking closer at the <b>5</b> organizations which have had a repurposed drug make it to FDA approval, they are on average <b>25.8</b> years old (range: <b>11 - 44</b>); their annual funding ranged from <b>$100,000</b> to <b>more than $5,000,000</b> (the most common selection was “<b>$1,000,000 and $2,000,000</b>”); and they have the following characteristics: <b>all 5</b> have an SAB/MAB, <b>3</b> have a natural history study, <b>3</b> have a formal research agenda, <b>3</b> already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing, <b>2</b>  have a patient registry, and <b>1</b> has a biobank. One of these organizations has no full-time staff, relying entirely on volunteer or part-time staff to achieve their success, while the other four have anywhere from <b>1</b> to <b>40</b> full-time staff.
        </p>
        <p>
            The amount of time that passed between initial FDA approval and repurposing approval ranged greatly, from 3 up to 21 years. Also worth mentioning that Selumetinib was a case of drug repositioning, as it was being explored as a potential drug for several indications, but was not pursued all the way to FDA approval; instead, it was identified as promising for an alternative use and received its first FDA approval for Neurofibromatosis.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to note that there are very many factors that affect whether a drug can ever get FDA approval that do not depend on its safety, efficacy and are beyond the control of a researcher or a rare disease nonprofit organization supporting a drug repurposing project. Notably the most important of these is whether the pharmaceutical company who developed the drug is interested in investing the time and money into supporting the FDA approval application for a new disease when it is already approved for another disease. Furthermore, FDA approval for the new disease is not always necessary in order to have a drug be able to reach patients in need (the primary purpose). Thus, we consider FDA approval to be one of many metrics of success.
        </p>
        <h4>Off-label use with some subjective measure of benefit</h4>
        <p>
            As an alternative success outcome to FDA approval, we can consider off-label, with some subjective measure of benefit, such as being freely available to patients off label with safety / efficacy data, providing significant reduction in symptoms, improvement in quality of life, increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality, provide cure of disease, provide prevention of relapse. If we look at organizations that fit this criteria for at least one drug, we end up with <b>12</b> organizations. They are on average <b>17.6</b> years old (range: <b>2 - 44</b>); the majority (<b>4</b> organizations, <b>33.33%</b>) reported annual funding between <b>$100,000 and $500,000</b>; and they have the following characteristics: <b>11</b> (<b>91.67%</b>) have an SAB, <b>6</b> (<b>50%</b>) have a natural history study, <b>7</b> (<b>58.33%</b>) have a formal research agenda, <b>6</b> (<b>50%</b>) have a patient registry, <b>5</b> (<b>41.67%</b>) have a biobank, and <b>3</b> (<b>25%</b>) already have an FDA-approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing (one organization has two FDA-approved drugs). Interestingly, <b>6</b> (<b>50%</b>) have no full-time staff, relying entirely on volunteer and/or part-time labor to achieve their success.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among these <b>12</b> organizations, there are <b>44</b> unique drugs being repurposed. The most common drugs among these organizations were <b>Sirolimus</b> (<b>3</b> organizations), <b>Trametinib</b>, <b>Everolimus</b>, and <b>Bevacizumab</b> (<b>2</b> organizations each). The most common identification method for these drugs was <b>Preclinical/Translational research</b> (<b>30</b>), closely followed by <b>data from similar diseases</b> (<b>17</b>) and <b>off-label use</b> (<b>17</b>). Most of these drugs are currently in early stages or clinical trials, specifically in <b>recruiting patients for clinical trials</b> (<b>18</b>). Their respective rare diseases have the following characteristics: <b>11</b> (<b>91.67%</b>) have animal models, <b>8</b> (<b>66.67%</b>) have cell lines developed, <b>9</b> (<b>75%</b>) have an identified genetic mutation, <b>8</b> (<b>66.67%</b>) have an ICD code, <b>7</b> (<b>58.33%</b>) have treatment guidelines, <b>5</b> (<b>41.67%</b>) have a clear understanding of etiology or disease pathogenesis, and <b>3</b> (<b>25%</b>) have predictive biomarkers.

        <h3>Correlational insights</h3>

        <p>
            We compared data on drug identification methods with the stages of the drug repurposing process and success outcomes. In the table below, drug repurposing stages are represented in the rows, while drug identification methods are represented in the columns.
        </p>
        <figure class=" py-4">
            <img class="shadow-2-strong" style = "width: 100%;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/about/contingency-full.png">

                Contingency table looking at drug identification methods and what stage the drug is currently in
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            From this table, we can see that preclinical/translational research seems to be the approach most often associated with clinical or late stages of the repurposing process, and in the outcomes, it is most associated with FDA approval or the alternative success outcome, off label use with measures of success.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also correlated the organizational characteristics with the drug repurposing stages. In the table below, drug repurposing stages are represented in the rows, while organizational resources are represented in the columns.
        </p>
        <figure class=" py-4">

        </figure>
        <p>
            From this table, we can see that having an SAB and community discussion platform appear to be the factors most associated with the clinical phase of repurposing and not being unsuccessful.
        </p>
        <h3>Collaboration across rare diseases</h3>
        <p>
            It is very interesting that the second most-selected drug identification method was
            <b>looking at drugs used in similar diseases</b>
            , as one of our research focuses was the levels of collaboration between different organizations, and we were specifically interested to see how much collaboration we would see among different rare disease nonprofits. With the data from the collaboration section of the survey (120 out of the total 147 of nonprofits provided this info), we were able to build networks. Each node in a network represents an organization, and each edge signifying a connection between them, either an explicitly mentioned connection via the survey data or an affiliation edge which was later added by the research team. The nodes are colored by type of organization, with a distinction made between our participating rare disease nonprofit organizations (Rare Disease Non Profit (RDNP), and other nonprofit organizations mentioned by the respondents (Non profit):
        </p>
        <figure class=" py-4">
            <img class="img-fluid shadow-2-strong" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/about/network-node.png" style = "height: 200px; width: auto;">

                Network node color legend
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            From looking at the network visualization, we can see that most of the rare disease nonprofit organizations in our data are actually part of one large “connected component”. A connected component means that there is a path between every pair of nodes. In other words, it is a group of nodes that are all reachable from one another by following the edges of the graph. The nodes here are sized by degree, with the largest two nodes being NORD and Global Genes, which is not surprising since these are large, umbrella organizations that each have hundreds of member organizations.
        </p>
        <figure class=" py-4">
            <img class=" shadow-2-strong" style = "width: 100% !important; height: 100% !important;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/about/network-top5-collab.png">

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Additionally, since we asked organizations about the types of collaborations they are engaged in with their top 5 closest collaborators, we are able to view subsets of the networks based on the type of activity. For example, we can see organizations who share data, share resources and share knowledge about their experiences (See Figure 12, in which green edges = yes, red edges = no). There is some overlap within those who come up as doing all three (consistently green edges across all three networks below), but there are some significant differences. For one, knowledge sharing seems to be a lot more common, as compared to data or resource sharing (evident by the fact that there are a lot more green edges, compared to the other two networks). Also, even though NORD and Global Genes are the highest nodes by their number of connections to other organizations overall, they were not reported to be in the top 5 organizations with which our participating nonprofits engage with data sharing or resource sharing with (evident by the fact that most of the edges in these two networks are red). This may indicate that even though these types of data sharing might still be happening, rare disease nonprofits work more closely with other nonprofit or academic institutions for these types of collaborations.

            In parallel to the survey, we extracted data on the repurposing of drugs according to an established medical resource for a select group of 68 rare diseases, a subset from the ROADMAP survey data. The team of extractors extracted a total of <b>1,054</b> (<b>542</b> unique) drugs for these <b>68</b> rare diseases. <b>926</b> drugs were listed as recommended or potentially helpful, <b>53</b> were not recommended. <b>702</b> (<b>71.7%</b>) were FDA approved for the rare disease in question, <b>203</b> (<b>20.7%</b>) were being utilized off-label, and <b>74</b> (<b>7.6%</b>) were not yet approved for anything in the US. <b>304</b> (<b>25.7%</b>) unique drugs were recommended but either off-label or not yet approved for anything in the US, which illustrates just how common off-label drug use is and how huge the potential for drug repurposing is.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also compared the two datasets: the data from this established medical resource and the data that met inclusion criteria in the ROADMAP survey by rare disease nonprofits. We found <b>33</b> rare diseases that were present in both datasets. Next, we looked at all the drugs (both off-label and FDA-approved) listed for each rare disease in both datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our sample, more than half <b>59/90</b> (<b>65.5%</b>) of the unique drugs listed for these 33 rare diseases in the ROADMAP survey by rare disease nonprofits are in data from the medical resource for the same rare diseases. The gap between what was mentioned in the survey and what was found in the medical resource could be explained by the fact that many of the drugs mentioned as “being repurposed” may not yet be used in patients or they may be referring to repositioned drugs that need an FDA-approval before they can be used in patients.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also found that only <b>59/404</b> (<b>14.6%</b>) of the unique drugs listed in the medical resource were also reported in the survey by RDNPs. So, a large number of drugs recommended in the medical resource were not mentioned in the survey. This could represent drugs that were intentionally developed for the disease of interest and/or a lack of awareness of drugs that have been or are being repurposed for the disease of interest, among others.

    <h2>Survey insights: Patients & Loved ones</h2>

    <p>
        <b>For rare disease patients and their loved ones</b> (these stakeholders received the same set of questions), we were interested in their experience with off-label drugs for their rare disease, including roadblocks in access, as well as their general attitude towards and comfort level with drug repurposing.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the majority of patients are aware of whether the drugs they are taking are FDA-approved or off-label, <b>28.8%</b> stated they are not aware of the status of the drug that they are on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most patients (<b>76.6%</b>)  have heard of the term “off-label” but have not talked to their doctor about using an off-label drug, nor are most of these patients (<b>66.5%</b>) aware of other patients using off-label drugs. Generally, patients are <b>very willing</b> to follow their doctor's recommendations based on <b>trust with their doctor</b>, as well as <b>drug safety and efficacy</b>. <b>109</b> patients received the survey from one of the 58 rare disease nonprofits which stated that they are currently or were previously involved in drug repurposing; 43 (39.4%) of these 109 patients said they were not aware of any drug repurposing initiatives being done for their rare disease. Of note, these results contrasted with the large proportion of off-label use reported by rare disease nonprofit organizations and physicians (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
        Patients stated that they were extremely interested (<b>77/296</b>, <b>26%</b>) in drug repurposing with the most impactful aspect being having more treatment options available (<b>232/296</b>, <b>78.4%</b>). Respondents strongly agreed that drug repurposing is generally safe (<b>32/296</b>, <b>10.8%</b>) and necessary (<b>118/296</b>, <b>40%</b>) for their rare disease. Patients reported no roadblocks in access to <b>301</b> drugs (<b>65%</b>) that they have been prescribed. This insight was interesting given that anecdotal reports suggest that insurance not approving off-label drugs can greatly affect patient access to potentially life-saving treatment, even if the drug repurposing process has been successful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, it seems that the patients and loved ones who participated in the survey have a positive attitude towards drug repurposing, but some are now aware of ongoing repurposing efforts or off-label drugs that may be promising for their rare disease. These insights can be useful for rare disease nonprofits to be aware of in crafting their communication materials, to make sure that their patient populations are aware of all the research being pursued and all treatment options available with sufficient safety and efficacy data, even if they are not yet FDA-approved for their rare disease.

    <h2>Survey insights: Physicians</h2>

<p>
    <b>For physicians</b>, we were mainly interested in the frequency and ​factors taken into consideration when deciding to prescribe a drug off-label, off-label drug prescription practices for the rare diseases they treat,and their levels of involvement in clinical trials for rare diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the small sample of physicians who participated in the survey (<b>21</b>), it is difficult to make broad generalizations. Among the physicians in our dataset, <b>70.6%</b> of them were aware of off-label drug options for the rare diseases that they treat and they prescribe them often.
        </p>
        <p>
            A little less than half of the physicians who took the survey (<b>10/21</b>, <b>47.62%</b>) said that they prescribe specific off-label treatments to their rare disease patients; these physicians listed a combined 26 drugs. When asked how effective these treatments are at reducing overall symptoms, physicians described <b>18</b>/<b>26</b> (<b>69.23%</b>) of the drugs that they listed as “somewhat effective.” Physicians described <b>17/26</b> (<b>65.38%</b>) drugs as “somewhat effective” at preventing worsening of their patients’ rare disease, and <b>20/26</b> (<b>76.92%</b>) as “somewhat effective” at improving their patients’ overall state of health.
        </p>
        <p>
            Physicians in our data reported that <b>80%</b> of the current off-label options do not completely address all of the challenges associated with their patients’ rare disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            More than half of physicians reported being at least “somewhat” familiar with drug repurposing (<b>12/17</b>, <b>70.59%</b>) and being aware of ongoing clinical trials (<b>11/17</b>, <b>64.71%</b>). Of those aware of ongoing clinical trials, all but two physicians (<b>9/11</b>, <b>81.82%</b>) said that they have referred patients of theirs to these trials. <b>100%</b> of our participating physicians stated that, if the opportunity presented itself, they would be willing to be a co-investigator on a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a drug that is being repurposed for a rare disease that they treat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the sample size of participating physicians was small (21), we present the data as an initial reference for understanding physician involvement in different aspects of drug repurposing initiatives. Making broad generalizations as to physicians that treat rare disease based on this data may be challenging based on the small sample size.

    <h2>Survey insights: Researchers</h2>
            <p>
                For researchers, we asked questions regarding their involvement in research projects to advance drug repurposing for any rare diseases, what their motivations are and what challenges they’ve encountered.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had <b>43</b> researchers participate in the ROADMAP survey, and most  of them stated that they are extremely interested (<b>20/43</b>, <b>46.51%</b>) in drug repurposing and find it extremely important (<b>22/43</b>, <b>51.16%</b>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the researchers who reported that their drug repurposing research is ongoing, <b>14</b> reported to be working on understanding disease mechanisms, <b>12</b> are searching for drug targets. <b>25</b> researchers reported that there have been drugs identified; among these, <b>10</b> are in the process of being considered which patients they are most likely to help, <b>8</b> have some preclinical data generated, <b>7</b> have not had validated in preclinical data. Among the drugs that the researchers are focused on, <b>sirolimus</b> was the highest reported drug (<b>5</b> cases), with <b>ruxolitinib</b> coming in second (
                <b>3</b> cases).
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the <b>31</b> (<b>97%</b>) of researchers that have done research related to drug repurposing in the past or are currently, the top motivation is its impact on patients. Their top difficulties were lack of funding (<b>20/43</b>, <b>46.51%</b>), lack of support/collaboration from pharmaceutical companies (<b>13/43</b>,<b>30.23%</b>), and lack of biospecimens (<b>8/43</b>, <b>18.6%</b>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Importantly, most (<b>30</b>, <b>83.3%</b>) researchers in our data reported engaging the rare disease patient population at least in some stage of their research process. Patients bring unique perspectives and insights into their conditions, which can inform research priorities and improve the relevance and quality of research outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among those researchers that reported to be directly involved in the dissemination of this information to the rare disease community, most (8, 80%) reported accomplishing this task by working with a rare disease nonprofit organization, though social media and traditional media outlets are also utilized to a lesser extent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the sample size of participating researchers was small (43), we present the data as an initial reference for understanding their involvement in different aspects of drug repurposing initiatives. Making broad generalizations as to researchers whose research relates to rare disease drug repurposing based on this data may be challenging based on the small sample size.
