                    Drug identification is an important early step in the process of drug repurposing. It involves identifying existing drugs that may have the potential to treat a particular rare disease. This can be done through various methods. We believe these approaches can be separated into five categories:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Drug Screen approach (High-throughput Drug Screening)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pathogenesis targeting approach (Preclinical/Translational research)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data from similar diseases approach
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Computational approach
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data from off label use approach
                    </li>

            In the ROADMAP survey,
            <b>94</b> (
            <b>76</b> unique) drugs were found to be in process of being repurposed by
            <b>40</b> organizations. The most common drug identification method was preclinical/translational research (
            <b>66</b> drugs), which can also be referred to as pathogenesis targeting (research identifies a potential problem underlying a disease [e.g., mTOR activation is increased in Castleman disease] and then matches a drug to reverse the problem [e.g., using an mTOR inhibitor to treat Castleman disease], which is then studied further in the laboratory). The other top choices were looking at drugs used in similar diseases (
            <b>29</b>), analysis of off-label drug use (
            <b>25</b>), high throughput drug screening (HTDS) (
            <b>21</b>), and literature review/meta-analysis (
            <b>16</b>). The least common approach  involved computational/machine learning/artificial intelligence (
            <b>2</b>
            ), which may speak to the novelty of this approach and its slow integration into the existing research/repurposing processes or that it is mostly being utilized without the involvement of rare disease nonprofit organizations.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Benefits of multiple methods
        </h4>
        <p>
            These methods of drug identification can be done simultaneously or in sequence, depending on the organization's resources and priorities. For example, an organization may choose to perform a high-throughput drug screen and conduct a literature review to identify a list of candidates and look for overlap between “hits”. Preclinical/translational research can help to identify candidates and help to refine the list to the most promising ones. As each method has certain limitations, using multiple methods can help to increase the chances of success in the drug repurposing process.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our survey,
            <b>57</b> drugs were identified by more than one identification method. The most common combination of methods was HTDS and Preclinical/Translational research (
            <b>11</b> cases) and looking at drugs used in similar diseases and Preclinical/Translational (
            <b>9</b> cases). This speaks to the value of pursuing multiple avenues at once and triangulating the findings from one method with another. It is also interesting to point out that the
            <b>11</b>
            drugs were identified as promising by utilizing different identification methods for different rare diseases.

<p class = "mb-5">
    Rare disease nonprofits are often small, volunteer-led organizations. They are susceptible to several internal limitations, which, though applicable to almost all stages of the process, in early stages of the drug repurposing process can become critical roadblocks that can prevent an organization from ever getting to identifying a drug candidate for repurposing:

        Not knowing how best to approach drug repurposing, an organization to be stuck in “limbo”, not knowing how to identify a promising drug or how to proceed once a drug has been identified. It can also lead to mistakes or oversights that may compromise the project's success. The CDCN hopes that the present ROADMAP and associated data helps at least partially fulfill this need and help rare disease nonprofits move forward in their drug repurposing journeys.

            There is evidence in the ROADMAP data that some organizations have been able to overcome some of these limitations and still be successful. For example, looking at staff limitations: among our
            <b>147</b> organizations,
            <b>52</b> (
            <b>38.78%</b>) do not have any full-time staff. This includes
            <b>34/111</b> (
            <b>30.63%</b>) of the organizations that support research and
            <b>20/58</b> (
            <b>34.48%</b>) of those that are pursuing drug repurposing.  Looking at the organizations that have been successful in drug repurposing:
            <b>1/5</b> (
            <b>20%</b>) of the organizations who have had a drug FDA approved, and
            <b>6/12</b> (
            <b>50%</b>
            ) of organizations which are using a drug off label with some measure of success do not have any full-time staff. This means that even if you’re a newer or smaller organization, you can bring treatments to patients through repurposing that have an impact on their quality of life in various ways.

    Additionally, many RDNPs are able to achieve success outcomes without their leadership team having medical expertise.
    <b>79</b> of the
    <b>147</b> RDNP leaders that participated in the ROADMAP survey (
    <b>53.7%</b>) noted that they are also either patients themselves or loved ones (often parents) and not researchers or physicians, and
    <b>1</b> (
    <b>1.27%</b>) of these organizations was able to make it to FDA approval with a repurposed drug, while
    <b>4</b> (
    <b>5.06%</b>
    ) have been able to get a repurposed drug available off label with some measure of success.
