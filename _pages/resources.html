    <h3> State of rare disease nonprofits in the US </h3>
    <p>
    
As our first step to building the ROADMAP, we set out to build a comprehensive list of all rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US. A team of volunteers spent seven months extracting data from the websites of these organizations, gathering basic information such as their year of founding, name & contact information of founders, information on the organizationâ€™s resources (conference, research agenda, biobank, registry, natural history study, etc.), whether the rare disease has treatment guidelines, or whether it is known that it is caused by a genetic mutation, is there any mention of drug repurposing, and if so - which drug(s) were pursued, or is there any mention of partnerships or collaborations with other organizations. As a result of this exercise, 711 organizations were confirmed as rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US with active websites as of 12/2021. Because this data is publicly available through organizations' websites and separate from the ROADMAP survey, we have made available open-source here.
