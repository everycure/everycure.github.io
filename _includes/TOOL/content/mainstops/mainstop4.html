            The validation stage of drug repurposing is a crucial step in determining whether a drug candidate is likely to be safe and effective in treating a specific rare disease and whether it should progress forward to more research. This stage typically involves conducting additional studies, prior to moving forward with giving the drug to patients and/or performing clinical trials. This stage can be separated into in vivo and in vitro studies, as well as preliminary validation through real-world evidence. Once the validation stage is completed, the organization often moves forward with clinical trials to gather more robust data on the drug's safety and efficacy in human subjects with the rare disease. In some cases researchers move straight from identification of a promising repurposing approach directly to treating patients in a clinical trial and/or outside of a clinical trial (off label), bypassing this stage.

<p class = "mb-5">
            The validation stage of drug repurposing for rare diseases faces several challenges in addition to the ones described in the prior stage. These roadblocks are more specific to the requirements of preclinical data and collaboration with external partners, such as academics, researchers, biotech companies, pharmaceutical companies, etc.

            <b>Limitations of preclinical models</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Preclinical models, or studies conducted in cells, tissues, or animals, before testing in humans, can provide valuable information on the potential effectiveness and safety of a drug. However, preclinical models may not accurately reflect the human version of the rare disease, which can limit the understanding of the drug's potential effectiveness.

            <b>Limited patient samples</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Rare diseases, by definition, affect a small number of individuals, which can make it difficult to obtain a large enough sample size to conduct meaningful research. Additionally, rare disease patients’ samples can also be limited, or access to them may be difficult; they may be spread out geographically, or not available for certain types of research studies. This can make it difficult to conduct research that is representative of the patient population, and can limit the understanding of the drug's potential effectiveness for validation. <i> See “Providing data/samples for research” for suggestions on how to overcome this roadblock. </i>

            <b>Lack of real-world evidence (RWE)</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            RWE refers to data collected in routine clinical practice, outside of the controlled environment of a clinical trial. This type of evidence can provide valuable preliminary information on the safety and effectiveness of a drug in a real-world setting, in a broader patient population and with longer follow-up. In the case of repurposed drugs, there may be limited RWE available, which can make it difficult to gain these insights. <i>See “Providing data/samples for research” for suggestions on how to overcome this roadblock.

            <b>Data sharing</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Academic researchers conducting the in vivo/in vitro research for drug validation may be hesitant to share their data, as they may want to be the first to publish their findings. This can slow down the drug repurposing process and make it difficult for the organization to access the information they need. <i>See “Partnering & Collaboration“ for suggestions on how to overcome this roadblock. </i>

        <p>
            Academics may prioritize publishing their research findings in scientific journals, which can be important for their career advancement and for the advancement of their field of study. However, this can make it difficult for organizations to access the information they need and delay the timeline of moving forward with the next stages of repurposing. <i>See “Partnering & Collaboration“ for suggestions on how to overcome this roadblock. </i>

            <b>Intellectual property concerns</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            IP refers to the legal rights associated with an invention or discovery, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. These rights can be used to protect the creators of the invention and to prevent others from using the invention without permission. In the context of drug repurposing research, IP concerns can arise when academics or organizations have discovered new indications for a repurposed drug, and they want to protect their rights to the intellectual property. This can make it difficult for other academics or organizations to access the information or resources they need to conduct additional research, as they may need to obtain permission or license the IP. <i>See “Partnering & Collaboration“ for suggestions on how to overcome this roadblock. </i>

        <p>
            To overcome these challenges, it is important to supplement preclinical models with other types of research, establish partnerships with other rare disease organizations, various academic institutions and research labs, establish transparent communication channels between stakeholders and clear data ownership and licensing agreements. Open-access platforms and data-sharing agreements can also facilitate greater access to research findings and resources, as well as establishing continuing to fund and support systematic data and samples collection resources.
