                    <p>
                        Once the drug is shown to be promising and preliminarily safe and effective, it must be tested in humans before being submitted to FDA for approval or integrated into treatment guidelines. This is traditionally done either through clinical trial testing and/or real world off-label use tracking. Clinical trials provide robust data on the drug's safety and efficacy in human subjects with the disease, and are necessary for obtaining FDA approval and making the drug available to patients, while off-label use tracking can provide additional data on the safety and efficacy of the drug in real-world settings.
