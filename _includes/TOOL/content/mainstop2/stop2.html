    <h1 class="mb-5">Research support</h1>

    <p>
        Drug repurposing is primarily a research process in order to identify and validate treatments for diseases,
        which have not been tried before. Nearly all (86%) of the rare disease nonprofit organizations that completed
        the ROADMAP survey support research in their rare disease in one way or another, while 58 (40%) are supporting a
        drug repurposing project now, or have in the past. Many organizations split up their research funding between
        novel drug development, gene therapy and drug repurposing. Drug repurposing for some rare diseases can provide a
        drug that provides full remission for at least some portion of patients, while for others it can simply be a
        good option to reduce symptoms, slow disease progression or improve quality of life in other ways until a more
        targeted drug can be developed. Drug repurposing, whether it is successful or not, also helps improve
        understanding of rare diseases and treatments, which can help support better and potentially faster novel drug
        development.

        Rare disease nonprofit organizations can play several important roles in supporting various types of research
        related to drug repurposing by:

                Though researchers may be experts in their field, a rare disease nonprofit organization can provide
                crucial insight based on the patient experience of having a rare disease. There are things that are
                important to patients, which may not be prioritized from a research perspective. For example, quality of
                life is more important for some populations than a marginal increase in overall survival rates; patients
                with chronic rare diseases may care about the effects of the rare disease or the treatments on more
                “everyday” things like fertility, cognitive development, as well as a decrease in overall pain or
                inconvenient drug delivery methods (needing to drive to a hospital to get regular treatments). This is
                why it is crucial that rare disease research is focused not only on filling the gaps in the literature,
                but also on the needs of the patient population. One example of this approach is CDCN’s <a
                    href="https://cdcn.org/aim2021/" target="_blank">All In Movement</a>, which leverages and integrates
                the entire community of stakeholders — patients, loved ones, physicians and researchers — to identify
                and prioritize high-impact research questions.

    <p>
        In addition to keeping the pulse of what is most important to the patient and loved one community, a rare
        disease nonprofit can also do extensive literature review to keep itself up to date on the latest research on
        its rare disease. This has a lot of potential benefits as it may:

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/svg/icons8/marginalia-696.png" class="img-fluid" />


    <p>
        Rare disease nonprofit organizations can help fund the development of research resources, such as cell lines,
        mouse models, biobanks, natural history studies and patient registries. These data and research samples can then
        be made available to researchers to pursue various studies, including ones that can lead to a drug being
        identified for repurposing. The following are examples of some of the types of infrastructure an organization
        can set up and maintain.

            <p>
                One of the most foundational ways a rare disease nonprofit organization can support research is for it
                to act as an intermediary between the patients and the researchers/physicians. In this way, its contact
                registry (a database of contact information for all your rare disease patients) becomes an incredibly
                valuable resource. It can be used to gather data, spread the news about opportunities to participate in
                clinical trials, and share research findings (including new treatment options as a result of
                repurposing).

                There may be dozens of researchers around the world which are already researching a specific rare disease, or doing research which is related to a potential drug target or potentially important pathway.

            </p>
            <p>
                A biobank is a storage facility for biological samples for use in research. These samples may include human tissues of any type (blood, lymph node, etc.) These samples can be included in basic research around disease mechanisms through translational research leading to treatments. Biobanks have the potential to accelerate rare disease research by providing access for researchers to high quality biological samples for their research. The operating costs of biobanks vary widely based on the scale of the operation. Though the costs can be beyond the scope of smaller organizations, there are commercially operated biobanks which can be hired to outsource the biobanking of rare disease tissue specimens. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the 147 organizations surveyed in this project, 45 (31%) utilize a biobank. This includes 24 (41.38%) of the 58 organizations that are pursuing drug repurposing. Looking at organizations that have successfully repurposed drugs, 1/6 (16.67%) of the organizations thatwho have had a drug FDA approved through a drug repurposing project have a biobank and 5/13 (38.46%) organizations which have reached a “subjective” success endpoint utilize a biobank. Among the 5 organizations who had a drug FDA-approved through a drug repurposing project, one (16.67%) has a biobank. Having a biobank of samples can be helpful in supporting several types of research projects which may lead to identifying potentially helpful drugs for a rare disease.

            <p>
                <b>Patient registries</b> are databases used to collect data (patient contact information, demographics, basic health information, medications, diagnosis, comorbidities, hospitalizations, etc.) and provide information to help researchers and clinicians understand the disease course over time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Natural history studies</b> are research studies that analyze data gathered in a patient registry over time .This type of study aims to gain a better understanding of the disease's natural course, including its symptoms, signs, and complications, as well as how it affects patients' lives. The information collected in a natural history study can be used to identify drugs for repurposing, and improve patient care. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are hybrid “natural history registry” options as well, such as CDCN’s <a href = "https://cdcn.org/patients-loved-ones/join-the-registry/" target = "_blank">ACCELERATE</a> in which patients self-enroll, the research team obtains medical records, and data collection is centralized and implemented into new and existing research priorities.

            <p>
                Among the 147 organizations surveyed, 59/147 (40%) utilize a natural history study or patient registry.

These findings ough these are all correlational relationships, it does suggest that having a natural history study or registry can be helpful in supporting several types of research projects which may lead to identifying potentially helpful drugs for a rare disease.

                <b>Tracking off-label drug use</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Off-label drug use</b> refers to the use of a drug for a disease that has not been specifically approved by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA in the US. It is quite common and is used in cases where a drug has been found to be potentially safe and effective for a new disease through research, or a physician has reason to believe it may help a patient from their own medical knowledge or anecdotal reports from other doctors. This can be incredibly helpful for patients that are not responding to the standard of care or have no standard of care for their disease. However, off-label use of drugs can also have risks. Since the safety and effectiveness of a drug for an off-label use have not been established, there is a potential for adverse events or lack of efficacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Tracking off-label drug use</b> can provide information on how well the drug works in different populations or for different conditions, as preliminary data to more formal research, or in lieu of formal research. This can serve as justification to support the official integration of this treatment into treatment guidelines or help a patient gain access to a drug via letter to an insurance company, if the request for coverage was denied. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To be able to utilize off-label drug use as an avenue for drug identification, rare disease nonprofits can systematically track off-label drug use in their patient populations by implementing a few different strategies:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Surveys and questionnaires</b>: Surveys and questionnaires can be used to gather information from patients and caregivers about their experiences with off-label drug use. These surveys can be distributed through the nonprofit's website, social media, or mailing list, and can include questions about the types of drugs being used, the reasons for off-label use, and the outcomes of treatment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Patient registries</b>: Registries can be used to collect and track information about patients with a specific rare disease, including information about the treatments that patients are receiving and its effects (and side effects) over time. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Collaboration with healthcare providers</b>: Nonprofits can collaborate with healthcare providers to gather information about off-label drug use in their patient populations in order to identify trends and patterns in off-label drug use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Literature review</b>: Nonprofits can help identify information about off-label drug use in their patient populations by searching for articles and studies that have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and reviewing data from clinical trials and observational studies. 
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Among the 147 organizations surveyed, only 17/147 (12%) track off-label drug use within their patient populations. This includes 16/111 (14.41%) of the organizations that support research and 12/58 (20.69%) of those that are pursuing drug repurposing. Looking at organizations that have successfully repurposed drugsour successful organizations, 2/6 (33.33%) of the organizations who have had a drug FDA approved and  5/13 (38.46%) of organizations  which have reached a “subjective” success endpoint track off-label drug use and 2/6 (33%) of the organizations who have had a drug FDA approved do this. By searching for examples of when a drug is used off-label and has an effect can help to identify that drug as a potential promising approach for further steps in drug repurposing. 25 (27%) of the drug repurposing projects in the ROADMAP were first identified from off-label drug use data. Among the 17 organizations that track off-label drugs, 5 (29%) of them utilized this data in an ongoing drug repurposing project as a drug identification method. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Though these are all correlational relationships, it does suggest that tracking off-label drug use in your patient population, either informally through simple patient surveys or systematically through a natural history study, can be helpful in identifying potentially helpful drugs for a rare disease.

        3. Providing data/samples to researchers & supporting clinical trials
    </h2>

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/svg/icons8/marginalia-696.png" class="img-fluid" />

    <p>
        Rare disease nonprofits have a crucial role to play in the support of research in early stages by facilitating researcher access to existing resources, such as patient registry data, biobank samples, contact registry information, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In later stages, rare disease nonprofits can support clinical trials in various ways:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Clinical trial recruitment</b>: serving as a resource for researchers and clinical trial PIs to recruit participants while simultaneously actively seeking out and sharing information about clinical trials for their patient population.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Patient education</b>: informing patients of eligible trials and discussing the pros and cons of participation, including potential consequences such as ending up on a placebo, associated costs, or having to stop taking a drug after clinical trial completion.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Leading or assisting in clinical trial protocol design</b>: assisting in the design of clinical trial protocols, depending on their collaboration and expertise. They can act as the administrative PI (writing the protocol, the MOU, and the application to the FDA, even if they do not have scientific or medical expertise) and provide input on protocol design to better represent patient needs and facilitate recruitment. They can also provide expertise on important clinical measures and endpoints. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Advocate for certain subpopulations</b>: adding or coordinating clinical trial sites, facilitating conversations with pharma companies to expand their ongoing clinical trials to include a specific subtype of rare disease patients to a clinical trial, or to add expansion cohorts to ongoing trials. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Collaborating with other rare disease nonprofits</b>: creating opportunities for collaboration such as joint-funding, increasing size of clinical trials, sharing data and samples, etc. For example, basket trials can help defray costs, coordinate efforts, lean on a shared infrastructure and PIs, benefiting multiple rare disease patient populations simultaneously. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Funding</b>: providing either seed funding, which can enable researchers to do preliminary work to then qualify for larger grants for clinical trials, or provide extra funding if external funding is insufficient to support a clinical trial. With enough funding, a rare disease nonprofit can potentially support multiple ongoing clinical trials, i.e. have eggs in multiple baskets to raise the chances of having a successful outcome. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There are many potential benefits to patients if a clinical trial is successful, such as more data on the safety and efficacy of existing treatments for various different patient populations, or new treatment options becoming available for them. There are also other benefits for the nonprofit itself in supporting clinical trials, such as - expanding their patient network, especially internationally. It also provides a great milestone in its mission to support research, which can serve as both internal motivation and help cement the idea that a rare disease nonprofit is able to be a partner in further rare disease research with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions.
