    Repurposing drugs for rare diseases
</h2>
<p>
    There are approximately 10,000 rare diseases affecting approximately 30,000,000 individuals in the U.S.A.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a>, </sup><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Despite significant investments in resources over the last several decades, more than 90% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA-approved therapy.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> This fact highlights the failure of traditional new drug development to overcome the unique challenges faced by rare disease research and the need for alternative approaches.
</p>
<p>
    Given that many diseases share the same underlying problems, the same treatments can often be used to treat multiple diseases. While this process is faster and less expensive than new drug development and repurposed treatments are sometimes found serendipitously, a number of barriers prevent this from happening systematically. Thus, repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs to treat rare diseases is a promising approach to help patients as quickly as possible. Similarly, drugs developed for one condition but proven ineffective or unsafe and thus never approved for the intended condition can also be used in another disease. Because the basic research and preliminary safety studies on the compound have already been completed, drug repurposing and repositioning is able to skip many steps and costs. Additionally, because the repurposed drug has already been proven safe and effective in another disease, it has a higher likelihood to succeed in clinical trials, compared to new, untested compounds.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>

    For purposes of this project, the definition of drug repurposing is: "A process of research to identify potential treatments that are already FDA-approved or in development for one disease, for use in another disease by gathering data and analyzing efficacy in order to improve treatment guidelines and access". This includes the following:
</p>
<ul class="liststylenone">
    <li>
        <b>Repurposing</b>: an FDA-approved drug used for another disease from the one that it is approved for.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Repositioning</b>: a drug with some safety and/or efficacy data in one disease and modifying its structure for use in another disease.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Reformulation</b>: a drug with some safety and/or efficacy data in one disease and modifying its method of administration or dose for use in another disease.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Rescue</b>: a drug thatâ€™s not FDA-approved for any diseases due to complications in either safety and/or efficacy in the intended disease and used for another disease while maintaining the same structure and method of administration.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Due to the complexity of the steps involved for each type, the ROADMAP tool was created with a focus on repurposing drugs that are on the market, however, we refer to steps relevant to repositioning, reformulation or rescue throughout the tool.

    There are a number of notable examples of drugs that have been repurposed to save rare disease patient lives, such as sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension (originally for erectile dysfunction)<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>, thalidomide for multiple myeloma (originally for leprosy)<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, and sirolimus for Castleman disease (originally for transplant rejection).<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    Given the above, there is tremendous enthusiasm and interest in how to repurpose existing drugs for rare diseases, particularly from rare disease nonprofit organizations. However, the process and steps for how to effectively repurpose treatments is not clear.  Through a partnership between the
    <a href="https://cdcn.org/" target="_blank">Castleman Disease Collaborative Network</a> (CDCN),
    <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/" target="_blank">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a> (CZI), and
    <a href="https://everycure.org/" target="_blank">Every Cure</a>
    , we launched the Repurposing Of All Drugs, Mapping All Paths (ROADMAP) project to identify the paths that can be taken to repurpose drugs, highlight the roles of various stakeholders, and centralize information on how to do this most effectively.
