<h3>
    Survey design
</h3>
<p>
    We designed a comprehensive survey using the Qualtrics platform, which included sections for several different stakeholder types: <b>(1)</b> rare disease nonprofit organization leaders, <b>(2)</b> rare disease patients, <b>(3)</b> rare disease patients’ loved one (<i>parent, spouse, friend, sibling, etc. of a rare disease patient</i>), <b>(4)</b> physicians who treat rare diseases, <b>(5)</b> rare disease researchers.
</p>
<p>
    Any member of the leadership team of a US-based rare disease-focused nonprofit organization was able to participate in this research project. They were then invited to directly reach out to their US-based patient, loved one, physician, and researcher network and invite them to take the survey. Since rare diseases predominantly affect children, we allowed participants under 18 to participate in the project through an adult loved one who provided informed consent and took the survey. Additionally, since many rare diseases cause physical and cognitive disabilities, we allowed those patients to also participate in the survey through a loved one, regardless of the patient’s age. Also, we included an option for patients and loved ones to participate in Spanish, in order to be as inclusive as possible.
</p>
<p>
    We focused our questions on potentially unique insights from each stakeholder:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Rare disease nonprofit organization leaders</b>: organizational characteristics (<i>age, funding, staff size, etc.</i>), level of resources (<i>biobank, patient registry, natural history study, scientific advisory board, etc.</i>), the rare disease state of research (<i>availability of treatment guidelines, diagnostic criteria, ICD code, biomarkers, etc.</i>), information on any FDA or off-label drugs being utilized, and drug repurposing experience, including challenges they’ve encountered, the support they need, and who was in their collaboration network.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Rare disease patients and their loved ones</b>
        (both stakeholders received the same set of questions): experience with off-label drugs for their rare disease and their general attitude towards and comfort level with drug repurposing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Physicians:</b> the frequency of and ​factors that are taken into consideration when deciding to prescribe a drug off-label, off-label drug prescription practices for the rare diseases they treat, and levels of involvement in clinical trials for rare diseases.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Researchers:</b> involvement in research projects to advance drug repurposing for any rare diseases, what their motivations are, and what challenges they’ve encountered.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    Preliminary Interviews
</h3>
<p>
    We conducted 10 preliminary semi-structured interviews with a selection of rare disease nonprofits, in order to receive feedback to refine the survey and project communication materials.
</p>
<h3>
    Survey Dissemination
</h3>
<p>
    We distributed the survey to all US-based rare disease organizations identified previously. Since this project is supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the survey was also disseminated by the CZI leadership team to the organizations as a part of their <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/rare-as-one/" target="_blank">Rare As One initiative</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The survey was officially launched on 9/29/2021 and stayed open for data collection until 1/6/2022. Because the survey included several sections and many of the respondents represented multiple stakeholders and were able to opt into multiple sections at once, we opted to include incomplete surveys at the end of the data collection period in order to gather the most data possible. In total, we received <b>1,923</b> total survey responses (completes and incompletes), which, after data cleaning and deduplication, included <b>723</b> total respondents (605 unique): <b>147</b> organization representatives, <b>340</b> patients, <b>170</b> loved ones, <b>23</b> physicians, and <b>43</b> researchers. Based on our search for rare disease nonprofit organizations, there are <b>711</b> active rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US. This means that we gathered data from approximately <b>20.7%</b> of the total sample, which is notable. Though there is an obvious selection bias to organizations who are interested or pursuing drug repurposing to take our survey, review of the characteristics of these organizations suggests that we captured a variety of organizations.

<h3>
    Targeted Follow-up Survey
</h3>
<p>
    Of note, an error in the Qualtrics platform was identified in which a significant section of the patient/loved one survey was not shown to any participants. To address this, a follow up survey with these questions was sent to the 344 participants who consented to follow up. Among the <b>200</b> that responded, we were able to successfully match <b>191</b> to their original responses (See Merging Procedure below) and <b>156</b> met all inclusion criteria to be included in the full dataset for analysis.
