  <p> 
    <b>Off-label drug use</b> refers to the use of a drug for a disease that has not been specifically approved by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA in the US. It is quite common (citation) and is used in cases where a drug has been found to be safe and effective for a new disease through research, or a physician has reason to believe it may help a patient from their own medical knowledge or anecdotal reports from other doctors. Additionally, doctors may prescribe drugs off-label for the disease which the drug is approved for, but for a different population, such as children, pregnant women, or other populations, which were not included in the original clinical trials. This can be incredibly helpful for patients that are not responding to the standard of care or have no standard of care for their disease. However, off-label use of drugs can also have risks. Since the safety and effectiveness of a drug for an off-label use have not been established, there is a potential for adverse events or lack of efficacy.

    In the context of clinical use during a drug repurposing project, off label use is an alternative to clinical trials if the latter are not feasible due to costs, patient size, lack of researcher or pharma support, etc. This is why it’s so important for a rare disease nonprofit to have infrastructure, whether informal such as a patient survey or a formalized natural history study, to be able to capture and track off label drug use. This will enable the nonprofit to not only be able to have a list of all drugs being prescribed or taken OTC for their rare disease of focus, but also track their effectiveness and side effects over time. This can be vital data to provide to researchers, and can be a stepping stone to more formal research, such as clinical trials, in the future.
