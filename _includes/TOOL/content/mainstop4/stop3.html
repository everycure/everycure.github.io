        <b>Real World Evidence (RWE)</b>
        refers to data collected in routine clinical practice, outside of the controlled environment of a clinical trial. This type of evidence can provide valuable information on the safety and effectiveness of a drug in a real-world setting, in a broader patient population and with longer follow-up.

                In the context of drug repurposing, all RWE data on a potential drug repurposing approach would be “off label”. RWE can come from various sources, such as electronic health records (EHRs), insurance claims data, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). EHR and insurance claims data contain detailed information on patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes, and can provide a wealth of information on a drug's safety and effectiveness in real-world settings. PROs can provide insights into patients' experiences and outcomes and can be used to gather information on a drug's impact on quality of life.

        While in vitro and in vivo studies indicating that a drug looks promising for a given disease are notoriously unreliable at predicting whether a drug will work in human patients, clinical RWE data is actual data from that drug in patients and is thus significantly more reliable for validating the potential utility of a drug.

        However, in the case of repurposed drugs, there may be limited RWE available, which can make it difficult to determine its effectiveness in the patient population of interest.  This can be particularly challenging for rare diseases, as the patient population is small and the disease may have a different manifestation in different patients. Further, confounding variables can make it difficult to assess whether a drug is responsible for the effect of interest outside of  clinical trials.
