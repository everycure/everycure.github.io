    <b>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</b> is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services that is responsible for ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices. It does not regulate vitamins and other supplements. The FDA is also responsible for ensuring that these products are accurately labeled and that they meet the standards set by the federal government.
</p>

<p>
  The FDA plays a critical role in the approval of drugs in the United States. The process of getting a drug approved by the FDA is a multi-step process that can take several years to complete. It begins with preclinical studies, which are conducted in the laboratory and in animal models. If the results of these studies are promising, the drug can then be tested in clinical trials, which are conducted in human volunteers. Once the preclinical studies are completed and the drug is validated in clinical studies, the drug sponsor (usually a pharmaceutical company) submits an application to the FDA for approval. The FDA then reviews the data from the preclinical and clinical studies, as well as other information about the drug, such as its chemical composition and how it is manufactured. If the FDA determines that the drug is safe and effective, it can approve the drug for marketing in the United States. The FDA also plays a role in monitoring the safety of drugs once they are on the market. The agency can issue safety warnings, require post-marketing studies, or even withdraw a drug from the market if it is found to be unsafe.

<p>
  For <b>drug repurposing</b>, the FDA must review and approve the new use of the drug. This process typically involves a new drug application (NDA) or a supplemental NDA (sNDA) which must be submitted by the sponsor (usually a pharmaceutical company). The FDA will review the data from preclinical and clinical studies, as well as other information about the drug, such as its chemical composition and how it is manufactured.

<p>The FDA has special provisions in place to expedite the development and approval of drugs for rare diseases, also known as orphan diseases, which are defined as diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. These provisions are intended to encourage the development of treatments for these diseases, which may not be as profitable as treatments for more common diseases.

      Orphan Drug Designation: The Orphan Drug Designation program provides incentives for companies to develop drugs for rare diseases. These incentives include tax credits for clinical trial expenses, a waiver of the FDA application fee, and an exclusive marketing period for the drug once it is approved. Source

      Accelerated Approval: The FDA can grant accelerated approval to drugs for rare diseases based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a marker that is believed to predict clinical benefit, but has not been confirmed by clinical trials. Source

      Expanded Access: The FDA also has a program in place to provide access to experimental drugs to patients with rare diseases who have no other treatment options. This program is known as expanded access, or "compassionate use." Source.

      Priority Review: The FDA can also grant priority review to new drug applications for rare diseases. This means that the FDA will expedite the review process for these applications and aim to take action within 6 months (instead of 10 months) of receipt. Source

      Citizen’s petition: A citizen's petition is a formal request submitted to the FDA by an individual or organization, asking the agency to take a specific action related to the regulation of a drug or device. Anyone can submit a citizen's petition, including patients, patient advocacy groups, physicians, and industry groups. The FDA is required by law to respond to citizen's petitions within 150 days. In its response, the FDA can agree with the request, deny the request, or take other actions such as requesting additional information or conducting further studies. Citizen's petitions can be used to request a wide range of actions from the FDA, such as requesting that the FDA approve a new drug, withdraw an existing drug from the market, or change the labeling of a drug. Citizen's petitions can also be used to request the FDA to take action on drug repurposing. For example, a patient advocacy group may submit a citizen's petition asking the FDA to approve a drug for a new indication, or a pharmaceutical company may submit a citizen's petition asking the FDA to change the labeling of a drug to include a new indication.

  It's important to note that the FDA's approval process for drugs for rare diseases can be complex, and the agency may require additional data and information before approving a drug. Also, historically drug repurposing projects that do not have support of the pharmaceutical company who owns the drug patent or was the original patent holder have not been successful in being able to support FDA approval submissions due to the costs and documentation requirements necessary. Additionally, FDA's role is to ensure the safety and efficacy of the drugs, which means that even if a drug is approved for a rare disease, it may not be covered by insurance or accessible to all patients.

<p>In our ROADMAP survey data, only 6 drugs (out of our 94 total or 76 unique) drugs, have made it to FDA approval: 
</p>

<p>
  Dupilumab // Campaign Urging Research for Eosinophilic Disease // Eosinophilic diseases
Selumetinib // Children's Tumor Foundation // Neurofibromatosis
Alpelisib // CLOVES Syndrome Community // CLOVES syndrome
Rituximab // International Pemphigus Pemphigoid Foundation // Pemphigus, Pemphigoid
Sirolimus // LAM Foundation // Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
Pazopanib // Cure HHT (NOTE - “Received FDA Breakthrough designation,” not FDA approval) // Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
</p>

<p>
  Looking closer at these 6 organizations, which have had a drug make it to FDA approval through drug repurposing, they are on average <b>26.7</b> years old (range: <b>11-44</b>); their annual funding ranged from <b>$100,000</b> to <b>more than $5,000,000</b> (the most common selection was <b>between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000</b>); and they have the following characteristics: <b>all 6</b> have an SAB/MAB, <b>1</b> has a biobank, <b>4</b> have a natural history study, <b>2</b>  have a patient registry, and <b>3</b> already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing. A testament to the dedication of their volunteers in the pursuit of success, one of these organizations has no full time staff, relying entirely on volunteer or part-time staff to achieve their success, while the other five have anywhere from <b>1</b> to <b>40</b> full time staff.
