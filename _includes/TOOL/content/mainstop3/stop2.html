        <b>Preclinical/translational research</b> was the most common drug identification method in our data (
        <b>66</b>
        drugs), possibly both to the fact that it’s the most traditional research approach and that it likely encompasses a number of different research approaches, including pathogenesis targeting.

                <b>Pathogenesis targeting</b> refers to the process of identifying and targeting the underlying biological mechanisms or "pathways" that cause a disease. By understanding the pathogenesis of a disease, researchers can identify key molecules or processes that are involved in the disease process, and identify existing therapies that target these specific pathways. For example, the CDCN uncovered that over activation of mTOR was important to the pathogenesis of Castleman disease and then found an approved mTOR inhibitor that it began testing on patients.

        <b>Translational research</b>
        describes a process of taking knowledge and discoveries from the laboratory and applying them to patients. There are very many research approaches that can fall into the category of preclinical and translational research. For example, proteomics can be used to quantify all the proteins present in a biological sample, such as a cell, tissue, or organism to understand a disease and identify potential repurposing candidates.

        <b>14</b> of the drugs identified through preclinical/translational research are still in early stages,
        <b>24</b> are in clinical trials,
        <b>9</b> are in late stages, and
        <b>5</b> have made it to FDA approval.
        <b>14</b> are being used off label with some measure of benefit and
        <b>9</b> have been unsuccessful. It’s important to note that
        <b>5/5</b> (
        <b>100%</b>) of the drugs that received FDA approval utilized some form of preclinical/translational research in their identification process,
        <b>4/5</b> (
        <b>80%</b>) in combination with other methods. The most common combination of drug identification methods in our data was Preclinical/Translational research and HTDS (
        <b>11</b> cases), and Preclinical/Translational and looking at drugs used in similar diseases (
        <b>9</b> cases). This speaks to the value of pursuing multiple avenues at once and triangulating the findings from one method with another. It is also interesting to point out that the
        <b>11</b>
        drugs were identified as promising by utilizing different identification methods for different rare diseases.
