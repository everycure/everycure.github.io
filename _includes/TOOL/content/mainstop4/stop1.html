  <h1 class = "mb-5">Clinical trial</h1>

  <p>
    Clinical trials are research studies that are conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of new drugs, medical devices, or other interventions in humans, after preclinical work has been done in cell lines and/or animal models to prove basic efficacy and some basic safety. The clinical trial process is divided into several phases, each of which has a specific purpose and set of objectives.

  </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Phase I clinical trials: These are the first studies in humans. They are usually small, short-term studies that involve a small number of healthy volunteers or patients. The main objectives of Phase I trials are to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes and excretes the drug) of the new intervention.
  </li>
  <li>
    Phase II clinical trials: These studies involve a larger number of patients and are designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new intervention. The main objectives of Phase II trials are to determine the optimal dosage and to assess the effectiveness of the new drug or device.
  </li>
  <li>
    Phase III clinical trials: These studies are large, multicenter studies that involve hundreds or thousands of patients. They are designed to provide more robust data on the safety and efficacy of the new intervention, and to compare it to the current standard of care. The main objectives of Phase III trials are to confirm the effectiveness of the new drug or device and to further evaluate its safety profile.
  </li>

</ol>

<p>
  Though some drug repurposing projects go through all 3 phases, most are able to skip <b>Phase I</b> since basic safety for the drug has already been established in prior research (though if the patient population is very different from the original, sometimes it’s a good idea to start with Phase I trials even for a repurposed drug). In many/some cases, phases II and III can be combined to answer the research questions faster and with less patients. 

</p>

<p>
  After clinical trial completion, there is a submission process for FDA approval. The FDA reviews the data from the clinical trials and decides whether to approve the drug or device for use in the general population. 

</p>

<p>
  Post-approval, <b>Phase IV</b> studies are done after the FDA approves the drug and these studies are called post-marketing studies, which are done to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the drug in the general population. It's important to note that the success rate of drugs in the clinical trials is very low, especially in the later stages of trials. Also, the time and cost of clinical trials are significant, and the process of submitting the application to FDA is very difficult without the support of the pharmaceutical company who owns the drug patent. Even with support, it takes months if not years for the company to put together the documentation packet, which is often several hundred pages long.

  As discussed in other sections, there is much complexity in the design, funding, recruitment and management of clinical trials. Here we would like to point out a few clinical trial designs which might be especially useful for repurposing work:

</p>

<h4>Basket trials</h4>
<p>
  are a type of clinical trial that are used to test the effectiveness of a drug in treating multiple different diseases or subtypes of a disease. In a basket trial, a drug is tested in a group of patients with different diseases or subtypes of a disease, who all have a specific genetic mutation or biomarker in common. This allows researchers to test the effectiveness of the drug in treating multiple different diseases or subtypes of a disease at the same time, potentially saving time and money and benefiting multiple patient populations simultaneously. This approach can be particularly useful for rare diseases, where the patient population is small and the disease may have different manifestations in different patients.

</p>
<h4>Umbrella trials</h4>
<p>
  are a type of trial that test a drug in a group of patients with different diseases or subtypes of a disease based on a common theme such as a similar pathology or biology (rather than a specific genetic mutation or biomarker like in a basket trial). This allows researchers to test the effectiveness of the drug in a variety of different diseases or subtypes of a disease that share a similar pathology or biology, also potentially saving time and money and benefiting multiple patient populations simultaneously.

</p>

<h4>N-of-1 trials</h4>
<p>
  also known as "single patient trials" are a type of clinical trial that are used to test the effectiveness of a drug in a single patient, rather than in a group of patients. These trials are designed to test a drug's effectiveness in a specific individual and can provide personalized treatment options for that person, as well as provide vital insights into the disease and treatment effectiveness, which then serves as the justification for designing and conducting larger and more expensive trials. This is an especially important option for ultra-rare diseases in which large-scale clinical trials are simply impossible or for rare disease organizations which cannot financially support clinical trials.
