                        The validation stage of drug repurposing is a crucial step in determining whether a drug candidate is safe and effective in treating a specific rare disease. This stage typically involves conducting additional studies, prior to moving forward with clinical trials. This stage can be separated into in vivo and in vitro studies, as well as preliminary validation through real-world evidence. Once the validation stage is completed, the organization can move forward with clinical trials to gather more robust data on the drug's safety and efficacy in human subjects with the rare disease.
