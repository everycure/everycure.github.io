                Off-label use of a repurposed drug that has been shown to be safe and effective through either preclinical and/or clinical research can provide access to treatments for patients, bypassing the regulatory hurdles, costs, and delays associated with FDA approval submissions. Additionally, the clinical trial protocol for such a drug may be streamlined as it is not intended for FDA submission, which could save resources for both the researcher and rare disease organization.

        Thus, as an alternative to FDA approval, we can consider a drug to have reached a success outcome when it is available off-label, with efficacy/safety data and some subjective measure of benefit, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Drug to provide a significant reduction in symptoms
        </li>
        <li>
            Significant improvement in quality of life
        </li>
        <li>
            Increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality
        </li>
        <li>
            Provide cure of disease
        </li>
        <li>
            Provide prevention of relapse
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Though it is worth considering that due to the fact that it is difficult to qualify what a “significant” reduction or improvement is, these measures are open to various biases and inaccuracies from both reports from patients as well as perceptions of benefit overall from rare disease organizations.

        If we look at organizations that fit this criteria from the ROADMAP data for at least one repurposed drug, we end up with
        <b>12</b> organizations. They are on average
        <b>17.6</b> years old (range:
        <b>2 - 44</b>); the majority (
        <b>4</b> organizations,
        <b>33.3%</b>) reported annual funding between
        <b>$100,000 and $500,000</b>; and they have the following characteristics:
        <b>11</b> (
        <b>91.7%</b>) have an SAB,
        <b>6</b> (
        <b>50%</b>) have a natural history study,
        <b>7</b> (
        <b>58.33%</b>) have a formal research agenda,
        <b>6</b> (
        <b>50%</b>) have a patient registry,
        <b>5</b> (
        <b>41.67%</b>) have a biobank, and
        <b>3</b> (
        <b>25%</b>) already have an FDA-approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing (one organization has two FDA-approved drugs). Interestingly,
        <b>6</b> (
        <b>50%</b>
        ) have no full-time staff, relying entirely on volunteer and/or part-time labor to achieve their success.

        Among these
        <b>12</b> organizations, there are
        <b>44</b> unique drugs being repurposed. The most common drugs among these organizations were
        <b>Sirolimus</b> (
        <b>3</b> organizations),
        <b>Trametinib, Everolimus, and Bevacizumab</b> (
        <b>2</b> organizations each). The most common identification method for these drugs was Preclinical/Translational research (
        <b>30</b>), closely followed by data from similar diseases (
        <b>17</b>) and off-label use (
        <b>17</b>). Most of these drugs are currently in early stages or clinical trials, specifically in recruiting patients for clinical trials (
        <b>18</b>). Their respective rare diseases have the following characteristics:
        <b>11</b> (
        <b>91.67%</b>) have animal models,
        <b>8</b> (
        <b>66.67%</b>) have cell lines developed,
        <b>9</b> (
        <b>75%</b>) have an identified genetic mutation,
        <b>8</b> (
        <b>66.67%</b>) have an ICD code,
        <b>7</b> (
        <b>58.33%</b>) have treatment guidelines,
        <b>5</b> (
        <b>41.67%</b>) have a clear understanding of etiology or disease pathogenesis, and
        <b>3</b> (
        <b>25%</b>
        ) have predictive biomarkers.

        It’s important to note that off-label use of drugs can serve as both a starting point for repurposing as a way of identifying a promising drug, a way of validating a drug through analyzing RWE of its during the repurposing process, and as a success endpoint for drug repurposing. It is also vital to continue monitoring the use of these drugs through natural history studies or patient surveys, to track any potential side effects or other issues that may arise.
