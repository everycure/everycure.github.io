  <h1 class = "mb-5">Abandoned</h1>

  <p>
    Though this is listed at the end of the ROADMAP, a drug repurposing project may be abandoned at any stage of the process. Some of the common reasons include:

  </p>

<h4>
  Lack of efficacy
</h4>
<p>
  If preclinical or clinical studies do not show that the drug is effective in treating the new indication, the project may be abandoned.

</p>

<h4>Safety concerns

</h4>

<p>
  If the drug is found to have significant side effects or safety concerns, the project may be abandoned.

</p>

<h4>
  Lack of funding
</h4>
<p>
  Drug repurposing projects can be expensive, and if funding is not available to continue the project, it may be abandoned.

</p>

<h4>
  Lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies
</h4>
<p>
  Pharmaceutical companies are often the sponsors of drug repurposing projects, and if a company is not interested in pursuing a particular project, it may be abandoned.

</p>
<h4>Difficulty in recruiting patients</h4>
<p>If it is difficult to recruit patients for clinical trials, the project may be abandoned.
</p>

<h4>Regulatory hurdles</h4>
<p>The process of getting a drug approved for a new indication can be complex and time-consuming, and if the project encounters significant regulatory hurdles, it may be abandoned.
</p>

<h4>
  Competitive landscape
</h4>

<p>
  If there are already other drugs available that are effective in treating the same indication, the project may be abandoned.

</p>

<h4>
  Lack of commercial viability
</h4>

<p>
  If the repurposed drug is not seen as commercially viable, it may not be pursued by the pharmaceutical companies.

</p>

<p>
  And though “abandoned” as a status has a negative connotation, it is very important to be able to filter out which drugs are most promising and which are not, and overall, having some drugs be abandoned can speed up the process of getting one that can bring the most value to the patient population.
