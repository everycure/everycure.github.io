      This section discusses insights from specific questions regarding collaboration, communication and open science between rare disease organizations.

            <p>
              Participating organizations were asked how many other organizations (regardless of type) do they regularly collaborate with on a regular basis, either for research or community-centered projects. Most organizations seem to have a small collaboration circle, focusing on just five or less (51 organizations) or five to ten (41 organizations) close collaborators.

            <p>
              For the top 5 collaborators that our ROADMAP organizations listed in the survey, the top activity that the collaboration is based around was sharing prior experiences that can inform future decision making, such as their drug repurposing experience, clinical trial design, resource development, etc. The second and third top activities reported are sharing a research agenda and other resources.

            <p>
              We were also interested in collaboration among organizations focused on the same/similar rare disease or one pertaining to the same genetic mutation. The majority of our organizations (80) reported the existence of these types of organizations in their rare disease space.

                <p>
                  Furthermore, we were curious whether there is close collaboration  between organizations focused on the same/similar rare disease or one pertaining to the same genetic mutation or if it was more of a competitive environment. Most of the organizations (67) did report that they collaborate on a regular basis, though 13 reported that they do not.

    <section>
        <div class = "container">
            <h2 class = "">Lack of collaboration</h2>
            <p>
              Out of the 13 organizations who reported not collaborating regularly with other organizations focused on similar rare diseases or the same genetic mutation, the top reasons cited were differences in organizational strategy and perspectives. Additionally, the absence of adequate staff, resources, and time resulted in a lack of prioritization for such collaborations.

                <p>
                  We also wanted to understand the general landscape of rare disease organizations, and whether it was common for them to merge or separate from other organizations. In our data, this seems not to be very common, with most (122) organizations reporting not to have done so.
