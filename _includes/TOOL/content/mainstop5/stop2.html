  <h2>Subjectively-reported success
    
  </h2>

<p>
  One way to conceptualize success in drug repurposing is through a subjective assessment of whether the drug has helped achieve a significant effect on something that is important to patients, outside of official FDA approval, such as:

</p>

<p>
  Drug to provide significant reduction in symptoms
Significant improvement in quality of life 
Increase life expectancy / decrease in mortality
Provide cure of disease
Provide prevention of relapse

</p>

<p>
  Because it is difficult to qualify what is a “significant” reduction or improvement without formal data with a clinical trial, these measures are open to various biases and inaccuracies due to this subjective nature. Nevertheless, we felt that it was important to calculate how many organizations in our data felt that they have reached one or more of these endpoints. Not only to be able to capture a wider variety of success definitions for the sake of the projects themselves, but also to engage with a more patient-centric definition of success, as there are things that are important to patients, which may not be prioritized from a research perspective or measured as a part of a clinical trial.

  If we utilize the criteria of counting an organization as “successful” if they have met at least one subjectively-reported success endpoint for at least one drug, and counting all other organizations as “not yet successful”, we end up with <b>13</b> successful and <b>45</b> not yet successful organizations. Looking closer at the <b>13</b> successful organizations, they are on average <b>18.31</b> years old (range: <b>2-44</b>); the majority (<b>4 organizations</b>, 30.77%) reported an annual funding <b>between $100,000 and $500,00</b>; and they have the following characteristics: <b>12</b> (92.31%) have an SAB, <b>5</b> (38.46%) have a biobank, <b>8</b> (61.54%) have a natural history study, <b>8</b> (61.54%) have a formal research agenda, <b>7</b> (53.85%) have a patient registry, and <b>5</b> (38.46) already have an FDA approved drug prior to pursuing drug repurposing (one organization has two FDA-approved drugs).  <b>6</b> (46.15%) have no full time  staff, relying entirely on volunteer and/or part-time  labor to achieve their success.

  Among these <b>13</b> subjectively “successful” organizations, there are <b>45</b> unique drugs being repurposed. The most common drugs among these organizations were <b>Sirolimus</b> (<b>4 organizations</b>) and <b>Trametinib/Everolimus/Dupilumab/Bevacizumab</b> (<b>2 organizations each</b>). The most common identification method for these drugs was <b>Preclinical/Translational research (31)</b>, closely followed by <b>data from similar diseases (20)</b> and <b>off-label use (17)</b>. Most of these drugs are currently in early stages, specifically the <b>recruiting patients for clinical trials (18)</b> stage. Their respective rare diseases have the following characteristics: <b>8</b> (61.54%) have treatment guidelines, <b>9</b> (69.23%) have an identified genetic mutation, <b>9</b> (69.23%) have an ICD code, <b>13</b> (100%) have animal models, <b>1</b> (76.92%) have cell lines developed, <b>4</b> (30.77%) have predictive biomarkers and <b>6</b> (46.15%) have a clear understanding of etiology or disease pathogenesis.
