                One of the greatest assets of a rare disease nonprofit organization is its ability to weave networks. A network of patients and loved ones becomes a community, where information sharing, support and advice can make a huge difference and combat the fear and anxiety of a rare disease diagnosis. A researcher network can bring together everyone who already is or is interested in doing research related to the rare disease of interest so they can share insights, data, samples and work together to apply for grants and complete work that can save lives.

        Outside of those two main networks, there are also other opportunities for collaboration that can bring great value to a rare disease community, but may be less known:

                making sure the research questions are patient-need-centered, providing funding, access to patient data and samples, helping with clinical trial design, recruitment, education, and forming a Scientific or Medical Advisory board (SAB/MAB). As with any partnership, it’s important to initiate a formal contract or clear rules of conduct, in which the nonprofit retains ownership of any data it provides or facilitates the use of, and has access to any research findings that result as a part of the research project it is supporting.

                collaboration with pharma is a roadblock for organizations pursuing  drug repurposing, 17/58 (29.31%) and one of the top reasons for organizations to no be able to pursue drug repurposing, 31/77 (40.26%). Still, collaborations are possible by aligning interests and incentives. Rare disease nonprofits can initiate these collaborations by inviting pharma representatives to patient and research conferences, and showing them the impact they can have on the patient population; they then can become "internal champions", who can advocate for the interests of the nonprofit internally within the pharma company.

                connecting with other rare disease nonprofits, whether it is ones that are focusing on the same rare disease, a similar rare disease, or one that doesn’t seem to be related at all, can lead to benefits such as combining patient populations, funding, and resources, creating a bigger impact and advancing research for both rare diseases. Overlap such as common drugs, side effects, and comorbidities can lead to new connections between research spaces, potentially resulting in impactful scientific breakthroughs.

                nonprofits can influence the FDA's policies and guidelines for rare diseases and help to create a more favorable environment for rare disease research. By working with other rare disease nonprofits, they can raise awareness of the unique challenges faced by rare disease patients, such as the lack of treatments and limited access to clinical trials; they can provide feedback on draft guidance documents, participate in public meetings and workshops, and provide expertise on specific rare diseases.
