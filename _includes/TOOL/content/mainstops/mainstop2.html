            Supporting repurposing involves laying the groundwork to be able to successfully repurpose a treatment for a rare disease.  </p>
             <p>
Early on in the repurposing process, it is important to take certain steps to set up the project for success. This can involve creating a rare disease non-profit organization (if one doesn't exist), setting up research infrastructure, fundraising or applying for grants to support research, building a patient contact registry, creating a network of researchers and physicians, and developing resources such as a biobank or natural history study/registry. 
   <p>
Rare disease nonprofit organizations can play a critical role in this process by serving as powerful intermediaries between patients, researchers, physicians, regulatory agencies, and pharmaceutical companies. Through their passion and perseverance, these organizations can help create and foster the right ecosystem to drive forward drug repurposing efforts for rare diseases.

    The ways that a rare disease organization can support drug repurposing projects fall into four somewhat overlapping categories:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Funding support
    </li>
    <li>
        Research support
    </li>
    <li>
        Partnering & collaboration support
    </li>

        Patient support
    </li>
