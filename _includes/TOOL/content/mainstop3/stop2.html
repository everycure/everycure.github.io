  <h1 class="mb-5">In vitro</h1>

  <p><b>In vitro studies</b> are research studies that are conducted in a laboratory dish or in a test tube, as opposed
    to in live animals or human subjects. These studies are used to investigate the effects of drugs, chemicals, or
    other interventions in a controlled environment, using isolated cells or tissues.
  </p>

  <p>
    In vitro studies are an important tool for understanding the basic mechanisms of disease and the effects of drugs on
    the activity of enzymes or proteins, or to test the toxicity of chemicals on cells, or the genetic or environmental
    factors on cells or tissues, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of disease.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are different types of in vitro studies such as:

      <p>
        These assays use isolated cells as a model system to test the effect of drugs or other interventions on a
        specific biological pathway or target.

        These assays measure the activity of an enzyme in the presence of a drug or other intervention, and are used to
        study the effects of drugs on enzyme activity.

        This method allows the growth of cells or tissues in a controlled environment, which can be used to study the
        effects of drugs or other interventions on the growth or survival of cells.

          High-content screening
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This type of screening uses automated imaging and image analysis to measure a large number of cellular features
        and can be used to identify compounds that modulate cell behavior or phenotype.

  <p>
    In vitro studies are cost-effective, as they have a lower cost and less ethical considerations than in vivo studies.
    However, the results obtained from in vitro studies may not always be directly translatable to in vivo systems.
