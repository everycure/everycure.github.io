<p>
    Among the stakeholders involved in the drug repurposing process, a rare disease nonprofit organization is a very powerful intermediary between the patients, researchers, physicians, regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other actors. Their power lies in leveraging their personal passion and perseverance against all odds to help the patients and their ability to create and foster the right ecosystem in which opportunities to drive forward drug repurposing efforts for their rare disease(s) can flourish. 
</p>

<p>
    The main support options in which a rare disease organization can support a drug repurposing projects fall into four somewhat overlapping categories:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Funding Support
    </li>
    <li>
        Research Support
    </li>
    <li>
        Partnering & Collaboration Support
    </li>

        Patient Support
    </li>

</ol>

<hr class = "">
<h2 class = "mt-5 overlay_heading2">
    Funding support
</h2>

<p>
    Drug repurposing projects cannot get started without sufficient financial resources in place. At any stage in the process, a rare disease nonprofit can play two roles: as a fundraising entity and as a grant-giving entity.  

</p>

<p>
    There are many ways an organization can raise money. One way to think about this is to focus on different entities that can contribute funds:

</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Patients & their families
    </li>
    <li>
        Individual large donors
    </li>
    <li>
        Government organizations
    </li>
    <li>
        Other nonprofit organizations
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The traditional approach to a rare disease non profit organization supporting research involves organizations raising funds, announcing a request for proposals (RFP) that invites researchers to submit a research proposal (a research question, approach to answering the question, and budget) that addresses the question or area of research described in the RFP, and then awarding funds to the best proposal, selected by a panel of experts (Figure 1).
</p>

<div class = "text-center">

    <img class = "img-fluid shadow-3-strong" src = "{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/traditional_model.png"/>
    <figcaption>The traditional model of an organization supporting research</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>
    This traditional, researcher-centric model works well when there are a large number of applicants and barriers to accessing key research material are low.  When the number of interested and qualified researchers in an area is limited, as in the rare disease space, it is less probable that a single proposal will both address a high-impact question and be submitted by the most qualified researcher. The RFP process also may lead to competition between researchers and limit collaboration, where samples and research ideas become assets for grant applications. This is particularly problematic for rare disease research as patient samples are inherently scarce. Without a sufficient number of samples, meaningful insights cannot be made. Another critical problem with the traditional model is that patients – the very people who share the lived experience and are in need of treatments and solutions – are often not involved in crafting or molding research priorities (Korsunska, 2021). 

</p>

<p>
    An alternative to the researcher-centric model is the “Collaborative Network Approach” (Zuccato et al., 2019). It consists of eight steps and leverages and integrates the entire community of stakeholders — patients, loved ones, physicians and researchers — to identify and prioritize high-impact research questions. One of the most important steps of this approach is a crowdsourcing process, which “allows the entire community to identify the most clinically relevant and pressing questions; any idea can be translated into a study rather than limiting research to the ideas proposed by researchers in grant applications” (Zuccato et al., 2019, p. 1). 
</p>

    </figure>
    </div>

    <p>
        Once the research priorities are determined and key studies are defined, the organization then recruits the most qualified researchers to conduct these studies. At the same time, patients are empowered to support research through fundraising and providing their biospecimens and clinical data.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Regardless of the fundraising or grant-giving model, there are very many things a rare disease nonprofit can contribute funding to, such as:
    </p>


<p>*The details will be explored in more detail in the <b>“Research support”</b> section.</p>

<p>
    Thinking specifically about drug repurposing, regardless of organization age or size, through leveraging an active community of patients, loved ones, as well as larger donors and philanthropists, a rare disease organization can start to create a “seed” funding budget for research projects which either directly or indirectly relate to drug repurposing. Even if these might be small grants not enough to complete large-scale projects, if the organization partners with the right researchers and they pursue the right research questions, these small grants can enable the first proof-of-concept studies to take place, enabling the researchers to then apply for larger grants from places like the FDA, NIH, etc.

</p>

<hr class = "">
<h2 class = "mt-5 overlay_heading2">
    Research support
</h2>

<p>
    Though many rare disease nonprofit organizations chose to focus only on patient support (providing a space for patients to connect, access physician lists, discuss treatment outcomes, etc.), a large portion (in our survey data, 127 out of 147 organizations were supporting research, and another 18 plan to do so in the future) also support research in their rare disease in one way or another. 

</p>

<p>
    Many organizations also don’t “put all their eggs in one basket”, and are able to simultaneously pursue novel drug development, gene therapy and drug repurposing. Drug repurposing for some rare diseases can provide a drug that provides full remission for at least some portion of patients, while for others it can simply be a good option to reduce symptoms, slow disease progression or improve quality of life in other ways until a more targeted drug can be developed. Drug repurposing, whether it is successful or not, also helps improve understanding of rare diseases and treatment reactions, which can help support better and potentially faster novel drug development.

</p>

<p>
    Regardless of the type of research, a rare disease nonprofit organization can play several important support roles:

</p>

<ol>
    <li>
            Leading the creation of patient-centered research agenda

    </li>
    <li>
            Creating research infrastructure & gathering data/samples for future research

    </li>
    <li>
            Providing data/samples to researchers & supporting clinical trials

    </li>

</ol>

<h3>Leading the creation of patient-centered research agenda</h3>

<p>

    Though researchers may be experts in their field, a rare disease nonprofit organization can provide crucial insight which cannot be found in peer-review publications which is based on the real-world patient experience of having a rare disease. Traditional approaches to research-prioritization tend to be researcher-centric, leaving out the very people who share the lived experience and are in need of treatments and solutions. There are things that are important to patients, which may not be prioritized from a research perspective. For example, though extension of survival is definitely important for both researchers and patients, a researcher may be surprised to learn that quality of life is more important for some populations than a marginal increase in overall survival rates. Patients with chronic rare diseases care about the effects of the rare disease or the treatments on more “everyday” things like fertility, cognitive development, as well as a decrease in overall pain or inconvenient drug delivery methods (needing to drive to a hospital to get regular treatments). This is why it is crucial that rare disease research is focused not only on filling the gaps in the literature, but also on the needs of the patient population. For example, the CDCN developed a novel approach to advancing biomedical research, called the “Collaborative Network Approach” (Zuccato et al., 2019). To overcome the limitations of the traditional research model, the CDCN’s “Collaborative Network Approach” leverages and integrates the entire community of stakeholders — patients, loved ones, physicians and researchers — to identify and prioritize high-impact research questions through a process called the <a href = "https://cdcn.org/aim2021/" target = "_blank"> In Movement</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to keeping the pulse of what is most important to the patient and loved one community, a rare disease nonprofit can also do extensive literature review to keep itself up to date on the latest research on its rare disease in question. This has a lot of potential benefits as it may:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Create an additional value-add on the nonprofit as a potential collaborator with both academics or pharmaceutical companies

        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Create opportunities to form cross-disease collaborations

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Identify new potential drugs to repurpose

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Enable the organization to learn from other nonprofits (what's already been done, what's in progress, what's planned elsewhere. You don't want to reinvent the wheel, repeat studies that have already been executed or are underway or are being planned, etc.)

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Identify researchers to collaborate with, invite to events, or to be a part of your SAB/MAB

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Learn how to model research approaches, including designs of clinical trials

        </p>
    </li>

</ul>


<h3>Creating research infrastructure & gathering data/samples for future research</h3>

<p>
    A rare disease nonprofit organization can help fund the development of research resources (cell lines, mouse models, etc.), and genetic testing/screening, which may provide valuable insight into the disease ____________, as well as potentially vital research databases, such as a biobank or natural history study/registry. This data and research samples can then be made available to researchers to pursue various studies, including ones that can lead to a drug being identified for repurposing. The following are examples of some of the types of infrastructure an organization can set up and maintainL

</p>


<h4>
    Patient network

</h4>

<p>
    One of the most foundational ways a rare disease non profit organization can support research is for you to act as an intermediary between the patients and the researchers/physicians. In this way, your contact registry (a database of contact information for all your rare disease patients) becomes an incredibly valuable resource. It can be used to gather data, collect samples for research, spread the news about opportunities to participate in clinical trials, and share research findings, including new treatment options as a result of repurposing.  

</p>

<h4>
    Research network

</h4>

<p>
    There may be dozens of researchers around the world which are already studying your rare disease of focus, or doing research which is related to a potential drug target or potentially important pathway. Finding them and creating opportunities to enable them to collaborate can drastically speed up the pace of innovation for your rare disease space. 

</p>

<h4>
    Biobank

</h4>


<p>
    A biobank is a storage facility for biological samples for use in research (citation). These samples may include human tissues of any type (blood, lymph node, etc.) and are determined by the pathology of the disease in question. Biobank tissue samples may be used in all types of experimental research. These include basic research around disease mechanisms through translational research leading to treatments. Biobanks have the potential to accelerate rare disease research by providing access for researchers to high quality biological samples for their research.

</p>

<p>
    The operating costs of biobanks vary widely based on the scale of the operation. Some biobanks operate on a budget of less than $300,000 per year, while large scale biobanks may operate with budgets in excess of $10 million per year. The majority of the budget of small and medium size operations is typically devoted to staffing the biobank and managing the facility costs (citation). Though the costs can be beyond the scope of smaller organizations, there are a number of commercially operated biobanks which can be hired to outsource the biobanking of rare disease tissue specimens. There are a variety of resources available, such as best practices published by The International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER) and the National Cancer Institute Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research Branch (NCI BBRB), both of which are available online. 

</p>

<p>
    Among our 147 organizations, 45/147 (30.61%) utilize a biobank. This includes 44/111 (39.64)% of the organizations that support research and 24/58 (41.38%) of those that are pursuing drug repurposing. Looking at our successful organizations, 1/6 (16.67%) of the organizations who have had a drug FDA approved through a drug repurposing project have a biobank and 5/13 (38.46%) of organizations which have reached a “subjective” success endpoint utilize a biobank. Though these are all correlational relationships, it does suggest that having a biobank of samples can be helpful in supporting several types of research projects which may lead to identifying potentially helpful drugs for a rare disease. 

</p>


<h4>
    Natural History Registry/Study

</h4>

<p>
    Natural history registries (NHR) and natural history studies (NHS) play a significant role in rare disease research, clinical drug development and treatment. Understanding the contributions of each and how they differ from one another is a necessary step in utilizing each database to advance rare disease research. 

</p>

<p>
    NHR is a tool that is used to collect data (patient contact information, demographics, basic health information, medications, diagnosis, comorbidities, hospitalizations, etc.) and provide information to help researchers and clinicians understand the disease course over time. Researchers can use data from the NHR to conduct a centralized NHS, a type of research which studies patients over a long period of time; NHS are critical for informing drug development, clinical trials, diagnostic criteria and critical care guidelines or other types of research studies. An NHR also lays the groundwork for establishing a biobank, which is a necessity for researchers studying the disease at a cellular/molecular level.

</p>

<p>
    There are NHS/NHR hybrid options as well, such as the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network’s ACCELERATE, which pairs a traditional registry with a patient-powered research approach, in which patients self-enroll and data collection is centralized and implemented into new and existing research priorities. Clinical insights support treatment guidelines, and de-identified linkage to a biobank enables translational discoveries.

</p>

<p>
    Among our 147 organizations, 59/147 (40.14%) utilize a natural history study or registry. This includes 52/111 (46.85%) of the organizations that support research and 30/58 (77.59%) of those that are pursuing drug repurposing. Looking at our successful organizations, 4/6 (66.67%)  of the organizations who have had a drug FDA approved and 8/13 (61.54%) of organizations which have reached a “subjective” success endpoint utilize a natural history study or registry. Though these are all correlational relationships, it does suggest that having a natural history study or registry can be helpful in supporting several types of research projects which may lead to identifying potentially helpful drugs for a rare disease.

<h4>
    Tracking off-label drug use

</h4>

<p>
    Off-label drug use refers to the use of a drug for a disease that has not been specifically approved by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA in the US. It is quite common (citation) and is used in cases where a drug has been found to be safe and effective for a new disease through research, or a physician has reason to believe it may help a patient from their own medical knowledge or anecdotal reports from other doctors. Additionally, doctors may prescribe drugs off-label for the disease which the drug is approved for, but for a different population, such as children, pregnant women, or other populations, which were not included in the original clinical trials. This can be incredibly helpful for patients that are not responding to the standard of care or have no standard of care for their disease. However, off-label use of drugs can also have risks. Since the safety and effectiveness of a drug for an off-label use have not been established, there is a potential for adverse events or lack of efficacy.

</p>

<p>
    Tracking off-label drug use can provide information on how well the drug works in different populations or for different conditions, as preliminary data to more formal research, or in lieu of formal research. Systematic tracking of off-label drug use can support its continued use and improve understanding of its effectiveness, as well as support the official integration into treatment guidelines. Having additional data on a drug can provide the scientific justification in a letter to an insurance company, if the request for coverage was denied. 

</p>

<p>
    To be able to utilize off-label drug use as an avenue for drug identification, rare disease nonprofits can track off-label drug use in their patient populations by implementing a few different strategies:

</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Surveys and questionnaires: Surveys and questionnaires can be used to gather information from patients and caregivers about their experiences with off-label drug use. These surveys can be distributed through the nonprofit's website, social media, or mailing list, and can include questions about the types of drugs being used, the reasons for off-label use, and the outcomes of treatment.

    </li>

    <li>Natural history registries: Registries can be used to collect and track information about patients with a specific rare disease, including information about the treatments that patients are receiving and its effects (and side effects) over time. 
    </li>
    <li>Collaboration with healthcare providers: Nonprofits can collaborate with healthcare providers to gather information about off-label drug use in their patient populations in order to identify trends and patterns in off-label drug use.
    </li>
    <li>
        Literature review: Nonprofits can help conduct literature reviews of existing studies and publications to identify information about off-label drug use in their patient populations. This can include searching for articles and studies that have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and reviewing data from clinical trials and observational studies. This information can then be provided to the researcher’s in the nonprofits’ network to evaluate whether any of the drugs are promising enough to pursue. 

    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    🟪Among our 147 organizations, 17/147 (11.56%) track off-label drug use of their patient populations. This includes 16/111 (14.41%) of the organizations that support research and 12/58 (20.69%) of those that are pursuing drug repurposing. Looking at our successful organizations, 2/6 (33.33%) of the organizations who have had a drug FDA approved and 5/13 (38.46%) of organizations which have reached a “subjective” success endpoint track off-label drug use. 

</p>
<p>
    Looking at off-label drugs is a drug identification method for drug repurposing, and was utilized __#__ (___%) in the projects in our data. Out of the 17 organizations that track off label drugs, ___#_/__% of them utilized this data in an ongoing drug repurposing project as a drug identification method. 

</p>

<p>
    Though these are all correlational relationships, it does suggest that tracking off label drug use in your patient population, either informally through simple patient surveys or systematically through a natural history study, can be helpful in identifying potentially helpful drugs for a rare disease. 

</p>

<h4>
    Providing data/samples to researchers & supporting clinical trials

</h4>
<p>
    Rare disease nonprofits have a crucial role to play in the support of research in early stages by facilitating researcher access to existing resources (biobanks, NHR, etc.), access to patients for their ideas an input on study prioritizations, and in clinical trials through:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Clinical trial recruitment: a rare disease nonprofit can position themselves as a resource for researchers and clinical trial PIs to reach out to them to recruit participants. The nonprofit can also actively seek out and share clinical trials which their patient population may be eligible for, even if they are not involved in the overall research project. 

    </li>
    <li>

        Patient education: telling patients about which trials they are eligible for, discussing the pros and cons of participation so that they understand everything involved (e.g. patients might get put on a drug that they can't keep taking after the trial, they might have to pay certain costs out of pocket, they might end up on a placebo, they might have to stop taking a drug which is currently helping alleviate some of their symptoms, etc.)

    </li>

    <li>
        Leading or assisting in clinical trial protocol design: there are several ways that a rare disease nonprofit can be involved in the design of the clinical trial protocol, depending on the type of collaboration agreed upon with the research team and, to some extent, the expertise of the rare disease nonprofit leadership team. It is important to note, that in some cases a representative of the nonprofit is able to be the administrative PI of clinical trial (writing the protocol, the MOU, and the application to the FDA) even if they do not have scientific or medical expertise; their expertise lies in their expertise of the needs of their patient community. In that capacity, they are well positioned to provide input on clinical trial protocol design so that it represents the needs and interest of the population and ensures easier patient recruitment. It is also very important to choose the right clinical measures/endpoints for clinical trials, which is supported/validated by preclinical research. A rare disease nonprofit representative may have expertise in what endpoints truly matter to patients, which may or may not be the ones that researchers find important or interesting. A rare disease nonprofit representative may also be able to advocate for inclusion or exclusion of certain rare disease subtypes or special subpopulations, such as children; in some cases clinical trial protocols can be amended, and previously ineligible patients may become eligible.

    </li>

    <li>
        Advocate for certain subpopulations and their interests: a rare disease nonprofit can work on adding or coordinating clinical trial sites, be involved in facilitating conversations with pharma companies to expand their ongoing clinical trials to include a specific subtype of rare disease patients to a clinical trial, or to add expansion cohorts to ongoing trials. 

    </li>

    <li>
        Collaborating with other rare disease nonprofits: Networking with other rare disease nonprofits can lead to opportunities for collaboration such as joint-funding, increasing size of clinical trials, sharing data and samples, etc. For example, basket trials can help defray costs, coordinate efforts, lean on a shared infrastructure and PIs, benefiting multiple rare disease patient populations simultaneously. 

    </li>

    <li>
        Funding: a rare disease nonprofit is also to provide either seed funding, which can enable researchers to do preliminary work to then qualify for larger grants for clinical trials, or provide extra funding if external funding is insufficient to support a clinical trial. With enough funding, a rare disease nonprofit can potentially support multiple ongoing clinical trials, i.e. have eggs in multiple baskets to raise the chances of having a successful outcome. 

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are many potential benefits to the patients if a clinical trial is successful, such as more data on the safety and efficacy of existing treatments for various different patient populations, or new treatment options becoming available for them. There are also other benefits for the nonprofit itself in supporting clinical trials, such as - expanding their patient network, especially internationally. It also provides a great milestone in its mission to support research, which can serve as both internal motivation and help cement the idea that a rare disease nonprofit is able to be a partner in further rare disease research with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. It also creates a domino effect in the research process itself: Phase 1 trial can provide rationale for companies to invest in phase 2 and ability to show success and progress, which can help with further fundraising efforts, which can help an organization grow in size and ability to do more for the patient community. 

</p>

<h4>
    PARTNERING & COLLABORATION

</h4>

<p>
    One of the greatest assets of a rare disease nonprofit organization is its ability to weave networks, whether its networks of patients and their loved ones, connecting them into a community, where information sharing, support and advice can make a huge difference and combat the fear and anxiety of a rare disease diagnosis, or a researcher network, bringing together everyone who already is or is interested in doing research related to the rare disease of interest so they can share insights, data, samples and work together to apply for grants and complete work that can save lives. Outside of those two main networks, there are also other opportunities for collaboration which can bring great value to a rare disease community, but may be less known:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Collaboration with academics: perhaps the main collaboration a rare disease nonprofit can facilitate is one with researchers from academic institutions or research centers. Since most nonprofits will not be able to support an in-house research team, most of the rare disease research, including drug repurposing, will be conducted via external partners. A nonprofit can play a variety of roles at various points in these collaborations: making sure the research questions are patient-need-centered, providing funding, providing access to patient data and samples, helping with clinical trial design, recruitment, education, etc. With those researchers that are most experienced and active, it is a good idea to bring them together as a formal Scientific or Medical Advisory board (SAB/MAB). Though it’s important to note that it’s important to establish either a formal contract or clear rules of conduct, in which the nonprofit retains ownership of any data it provides or facilitates the use of, and has access to any research findings that result as a part of the research project it is supporting. This is due to a clash of incentives, in which academics are disincentivized to publish null or negative findings or research, or may not release data from a study until a later time for various reasons, and this may put the supporting nonprofit at a disadvantage.

    </li>
    <li>
        Collaboration with pharmaceutical companies and biotech companies: though 17/58 (29.31%) of our drug repurposing organizations said that collaboration with pharma is a roadblock for them and 31/77 (40.26%) of the organizations who have not pursued drug repurposing listed it as a reason for why, it is possible to form ongoing collaborations if interests and incentives align to include a rare disease patient population in an ongoing clinical trial, or at least provide drug free of charge for ongoing research. One way a rare disease nonprofit can do this is by having an “internal champion” - someone who cares about the rare disease, has connected with the nonprofit and can help push through initiatives in the company internally; One way to create these “internal champions” is by inviting pharma reps to patient and research conferences, and keeping them engaged by not only showing the the financial incentives, but also the impact they can have on the patient population.

    </li>
    <li>
        Collaboration with other rare disease nonprofits: there is a huge potential to be gained by connecting with other rare disease nonprofits, whether it is ones that are focusing on the same rare disease, a similar rare disease, a rare disease in the same category or affecting the same system in the body, or one that doesn’t seem to be related at all. By connecting with other other rare disease nonprofits focused on the same/similar rare diseases, it is possible to combine patient populations, funding and other resources and overall have a bigger impact on each individual rare disease, as well as further the research on the field as a whole. Also, though more difficult, through finding overlap such as a common drug being utilized, a common side effect or comorbidity, you can forge connections between research spaces that have never been made before, which has the potential for really impactful scientific breakthroughs.

    </li>

    <li>
        Collaboration with regulatory bodies: by working together with other rare disease nonprofits, the organization can help to amplify the voices and concerns of patients and families affected by rare diseases and not be lost in a focus on one specific rare disease. For example, they can work to raise awareness of the unique challenges faced by rare disease patients, such as the lack of treatments and limited access to clinical trials, which can help to influence the FDA's policies and guidelines for the development, testing, and approval of drugs for rare diseases, and help to create a more favorable environment for rare disease research. In addition to this, rare disease organizations can also collaborate with regulatory bodies by providing feedback on draft guidance documents, participating in public meetings and workshops, and by providing expertise on specific rare diseases. This type of collaboration can help to ensure that the perspectives of patients and their families are considered in the regulatory process, and can help to improve the chances of success for new treatments and therapies.

    </li>
</ul>

    <h4>
        PATIENT SUPPORT

    </h4>

    <p>
        Rare disease nonprofits can provide direct patient support in the process of drug repurposing in various ways:

    </p>

    <ul>

        <li>
            Provide treatment-related assistance to patients by working with insurance companies to ensure coverage and promote patient access to new drugs that have been approved by the FDA, or off label drugs which have been newly identified or being tested in the drug repurposing process.

        </li>
        <li>
            Facilitate compassionate use access, which allows patients with a serious or life-threatening disease to access investigational drugs outside of clinical trials, if the patients are not eligible or if the clinical trial does not happen for various reasons.

        </li>
        <li>
            Provide access to a network of physicians who are the most knowledgeable about the disease and the treatments available, including ones that are involved in drug repurposing projects. 

        </li>
        <li>
            Provide access to genetic testing for patients to determine if they have a specific rare disease and help identify appropriate treatment options, which may lead to the identification of new drug repurposing opportunities.

        </li>
        <li>
            Disseminate rare disease-specific educational information to patients, families, and healthcare providers through various channels such as their website, social media, newsletters and patient conferences. This may include research results, updated treatment guidelines, lists of ongoing clinical trials, etc.
