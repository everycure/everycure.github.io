                <b>In vivo studies</b>
                are research studies that are conducted in live animals, as opposed to in a laboratory dish (in vitro) or in a computer simulation (in silico). These studies are used to investigate the effects of drugs, chemicals, or other interventions on living organisms in their natural environment. These studies can be an important tool for understanding the safety and efficacy of a repurposed drug for a rare disease. They are used to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, and to test their toxicity, side effects, and efficacy in a living organism.

        Small animals such as mice, rats, and zebrafish are commonly used for in vivo research. These animals are relatively inexpensive, easy to handle, and have a short lifespan, which allows for the rapid completion of studies. Additionally, many of these animals have genetic similarities to humans, which makes them suitable models for human diseases. It's also fairly easy to modify these animals to carry a disease-causing mutation and serve as a “model” of the human disease, which helps to inform understanding of the human disease and test drug efficacy to reverse the disease.

        However, it's important to note that in vivo studies have ethical considerations and are subject to strict regulations. Additionally, results obtained from animal studies may not always be directly translatable to humans, so even drugs which seem promising in animal models may not end up being successful in being repurposed.
