    We designed a comprehensive survey and implemented itn with the Qualtrics platform, which includedwith question sections for several different stakeholder types: (1) rare disease nonprofit organization leaders, (2) rare disease patients, (3) rare disease patients’ loved one (parent, spouse, friend, sibling, etc. of a rare disease patient), (4) physicians who treat rare diseases, (5) rare disease researchers. 

</p>

<p>
    Any member of the leadership team of a US-based rare disease-focused nonprofit organization were able to participate in this research project. They were then invited to directly reach out to their US-based patient, loved one, physician and researcher network and invite them to take the survey. Since rare diseases predominantly affect children, we allowed participants under 18 to participate in the project through an adult loved one who provided informed consent and took the survey. Additionally, since many rare diseases cause physical and cognitive disabilities, we allowed those patients to also participate in the survey through a loved one, regardless of the patient’s age in that case. Also, we included an option for patients and loved ones to participate in Spanish, in order to be as inclusive as possible.since we anticipated that a large portion of the population might not be fluent English speakers.

    Each of these stakeholders had a unique insight into drug repurposing for rare diseases that we wanted to capture: 

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        For rare disease nonprofit organization leaders :we were focusing on capturing their organizational characteristics (age, funding, staff size, etc.), level of resources (biobank, patient registry, natural history study, scientific advisory board. etc), rare disease state of research (availability of treatment guidelines, diagnostic criteria, ICD code, biomarkers, etc.), information on any FDA or off label drugs being utilized for their rare disease of focus as well as their efficacy, availability and access, their , and drug repurposing experience, including challenges they’ve encountered, support they need, and who was in their collaboration network. 

    </li>
    <li>
        For rare disease patients and their loved ones (these stakeholders received the same set of questions): we were interested in their experience with off label drugs for their rare disease, including roadblocks in access,  as well as their general attitude towards and comfort level with drug repurposing. 

    </li>
    <li>
        For physicians,: we were mainly interested in the frequency and ​factors taken into consideration when deciding to prescribe a drug off-label, off-label drug prescription practices for the rare diseases they treat, and as well as their levels of involvement in clinical trials for rare diseases. 

    </li>
    <li>
        For researchers,: we asked questions regarding their involvement in research projects to advance drug repurposing for any rare diseases, what their motivations are, what challenges they’ve encountered. 

    </li>
</ul>

    <b>Preliminary Interviews</b><br>
    We conducted 10 preliminary semi-structured interviews with a selection of rare disease nonprofits. The goals of these meetings waswere to gatherget their general thoughts about the project and obtain their feedback on theour survey drafts. This information was used to refine the survey and communication materials.

    <b>Survey Dissemination</b><br>
    Our contract list was created by using the As described in a prior section, we had previously compiled a comprehensive list of US-based rare disease organizations (as described in prior section) and then. We had also collectinged email addresses from these organizations’ websites. This contact list was utilized to email an invitation to participate in the project. We sent 755 invitations to participate (39 of the emails had issues and were not delivered). Since this project is supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the survey was also disseminated by the CZI leadership team to the organizations as a part of their <a href = "https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/rare-as-one/" target = "_blank">Rare As One initiative</a>.

<p>
    The survey was officially launched on 9/29/2021 and stayed open for data collection until 1/6/2022. Because the survey included several sections and many of the respondents represented multiple stakeholders and were able to opt into multiple sections at once, we opted to mark all surveys in progress as “complete” at the end of the data collection period in order to gather the most data possiblenot lose completed sections if the respondents opted into several sections and did not complete one or more. In total, we collectedreceived 1,923 total survey responses (completes and incompletes), which, after data cleaning and deduplication, included 147 organization representatives, 340 patients, 170 loved ones, 23 physicians and 43 researchers. According to our crowdsourced data, there are 711 active rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US. This means that theseour 147 organizations account forconstitute 20.7% of the total sample size and response rate, which is significant. Though there is an obvious selection bias to organizations who are interested or pursuing drug repurposing to take our survey, we are confident that we capturedwere able to capture a good variety of organizations based on a numbervariety of different characteristics.

    <b>Follow up Survey
    </b><br>
    During early stage analysis, an error in the Qualtrics platform was identified in which a significant section of the patient/loved one survey was not shown to any participants. Because the participants in the survey were able to voluntarily consent to email follow ups and provide their email addresses, those participants who opted into the patient/loved one survey and provided consent and contact information were then sent a follow up survey which contained these questions. 344 patients and loved ones were contacted to participate in the follow up survey, 200 responded and we were able to successfully match 191 to their original responses, 156 of which remained after data cleaning and became a part of the full dataset for analysis.
